= Dependent Deployments - Map Server

== Overview

In this tutorial we will create a dynamic_map_server cloud deployment
which will serve a map to dependent deployments. Dependent deployments
bind to their dependencies at run-time and have access to their exposed
topics, services and actions.

== Creating the dynamic_map_server

First we will create the dynamic_map_server package and deployment. The
dynamic_map_server is a modified http://wiki.ros.org/map_server[map_server]
which exposes an additional service */set_map*. The */set_map* service
is used to replace the map that is published on the */map* topic.

Go to 'Catalog' in the left sidebar and then click 'Add New Package'.

Fill in the package name, version, and git URL. We will leave the
command field empty and use parameters to launch the package instead.
Use the following git URL:

    https://github.com/rapyuta/io_tutorials

Next, we need to expose the */map* and */map_metadata* topics.

Now expose the */set_map* service.

Finally, we will use parameters to tell rapyuta.io which package and which
launchfile to execute from inside the github repository. Add two parameters
fields. Set 'ROS_PKG' to 'dynamic_map_server' and set 'ROS_LAUNCH_FILE' to
'map_server.launch'.

Now you can click 'submit'.

In the 'Catalog', click your new package (dynamic-map-server-5 below),
and then click 'Deploy Package'.

Go to the 'deployments' page and make a note of the deployment id of the
dynamic-map-server deployment.

== Creating a dependent deployment

In this section, we will launch a map_listener node on the device.
By adding the dynamic_map_server as a dependent deployment, when ROS is
launched, the cloud bridge will automatically be launched and the topics and
services of the dynamic_map_server will be exposed.

A device should already be prepared and added.
(See link:../../getting_started/adding_new_device.html[adding a new device]).
On the device, execute the following commands:

    cd ~
    mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
    cd catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/rapyuta/io_tutorials
    cd ..
    source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
    catkin build map_listener

Now create the package. Once again, go to 'Catalog' in the left sidebar
and then click 'Add New Package'. Move to the advanced section tab.
Fill in the name, version and description.

Next, go to the 'components' section and change the component from 'Cloud'
to 'Device'. Name the component and set the executable field to the following.

    source /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash && roslaunch map_listener listener.launch

Notice that we are leaving the 'dependent deployments' field blank.
We will specify the dependent deployment during deployment of our subscriber
package instead.

Now you can click 'submit'.

In 'Catalog', click your new package, and then click 'Deploy Package'.
You will see the 'Select plan' modal. Keep the default plan.
Underneath, click 'Get Devices' and make sure you can see the device
you previously added. Now click 'continue'.

Here is where you will finally add the map server as a dependent
deployment.

First, add the following scripts to 'ROS Setup Script' section. Order is important!

    /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
    /opt/rapyuta/catkin/devel/setup.bash

Now, add a dependent deployment and enter the id of the dynamic-map-server deployment
that you noted above.

image::dependent_map_server/dependent-deployments-2.png[]

Finally, click 'Create Deployment'.

To check the map_listener node received map data, type the following:

    sudo tail /root/.ros/log/latest/map_listener-2.log

You should see text similar to the following:

    [rosout][INFO] 2018-01-26 06:18:56,565: Received map data
    [rosout][INFO] 2018-01-26 06:18:56,578: Read a 4000 X 4000 map @ 0.0500000007451 m/cell

== Updating the map

In a terminal connected to the device, type the following:

    sudo tail -f /root/.ros/log/latest/rosout.log

Open a separate terminal to the device and type the following:

    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    rosservice call /set_map <tab-complete>

In the first terminal, you should see the map_listener receive a new map.
