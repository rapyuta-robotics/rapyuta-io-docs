This tutorial will show you how to deploy a basic ROS package with a ROS publisher running in the cloud and a ROS subscriber running on a Raspberry Pi.
The ROS publisher sits in a public git repository and is built into a Docker container on the fly using `ros-indigo-catkin` build recipe.
The ROS subscriber is assumed to be downloaded on Raspberry Pi and is launched when the package is deployed using rapyuta.io console UI or the
link:../rapyuta_io_sdk/sdk_docs.html[rapyuta.io SDK].

== Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you should have the following:

* Raspberry Pi 3.
* Micro SD card of at least 4 Gb.
* Internet connection for your Raspberry Pi over Ethernet.

== Preparing the Raspberry Pi 3
We are going to use Ubuntu 16.04 on the Raspberry Pi. It is not officially supported, but there is an image available that we will use for this tutorial.

1. Download the image `ubuntu-16.04-preinstalled-server-armhf+raspi3.img.xz` from link:https://ubuntu-pi-flavour-maker.org/download/[here] or
link:https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/RaspberryPi[here].

[TIP]
====
If you use this image link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/14jAm71TMTEcwd-VDagovpIhQMmQKhWJC/view[here] you can skip after step 6.
====

2. To make the SD card flashing easier, download and install link:https://etcher.io/[Etcher].
3. Mount the micro SD card on your computer and flash it using Etcher.

image::ros_pub_sub/etcher.png["Flashing the SD card with Etcher"]

[start=4]
4. Insert the micro SD card on the Raspberry Pi micro SD card slot and power it.
5. Connect the Ethernet port of the Raspberry Pi to a router that provides internet access.

[TIP]
====
    You could use `nmap` to find the device IP:
    nmap -sn 1.2.3.0/24 // replace 1.2.3 for your local IP address.
====

[start=6]
5. To make sure that everything is OK so far, try to ssh into the Raspberry Pi. Default user and password are `ubuntu`. You will be required
to change the password as soon as you log in.

    ssh ubuntu@<device IP>

[TIP]
Alternatively you may use as serial terminal to achieve the same result.
[CAUTION]
The actual on-boarding requires connectivity to rapyuta.io

[start=7]
7. Some more configuration is required to avoid problems in the future. Open with root permissions the file `/etc/default/locale` and add the following line:

    LC_ALL=C

8. In the `/etc/hosts` file of the Raspberry Pi, add the following line:

    127.0.1.1 ubuntu

9. Install ROS on the Raspberry Pi following the link:http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu[official instructions]. We recommend installing
*ROS-Base*. Also, please make sure that you have link:http://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html[catkin tools] present on your device

10. Currently, rapyuta.io does not install the components on the device. Therefore, you have to get and compile the `listener` package that will run on the device. For this:

.. On your device, create a catkin workspace under the `home` folder (both Catkin and Catkin tools are OK):

    cd $HOME
    mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
    cd catkin_ws/src
    source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

.. Get the code for the ROS listener:

    git clone https://github.com/rapyuta/io_tutorials
    cd ..

.. Build the package:

    catkin build listener

Once the compilation is finished, you can check that everything is correct:

    source devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch listener listener.launch

image::ros_pub_sub/comp_ok.png["Listener correctly running on the Raspberry Pi"]

Kill the roslaunch process (Ctrl + C) before proceeding to the next step.

== Setting the Raspberry Pi as rapyuta.io device
So far, we have set the minimum requirements for the Raspberry Pi. Now, it is time to integrate them into rapyuta.io.

1. Follow link:../../getting_started/creating_users_groups.html[these instructions] to create a user if you do not have one yet. It is not
necessary to create a group.
2. To add your devices to rapyuta.io, follow link:../../getting_started/adding_new_device.html[these instructions]. Note that you have to run the
device setup link with root permissions.


== Creating the package
The packages have to be created from the rapyuta.io Console UI:

1. Sign in to https://console.rapyuta.io/login[rapyuta.io console UI].
2. On the left bar, go to the *Catalog* tab and click on *Add New Package*.
3. Choose your package name, version, and add a description.
4. This package will only have one plan. Choose the name for the plan and leave `Shared plan` unchecked.

image::ros_pub_sub/pkg_1.png["Package configuration."]

[start=5]
5. The package will have two components: the talker running on the cloud and the listener running on the device:
.. Talker component:
... Select a name and a description for the `talker` component. Select `Cloud` as required runtime and check `Is ROS` box.
... In this case, we will have one executable from a git repository. Therefore, select git and add this URL: https://github.com/rapyuta/io_tutorials
... This executable will publish a topic `/telemetry`. We want this topic to arrive at the device. Therefore, add the `/telemetry` topic with max QoS
(usually a telemetry topic would not have max QoS, take this as an example), and leave the scope as global.
... Finally, rapyuta.io needs to know what to launch from the repository, as it might have many packages and roslaunch files.
Therefore, add *_roslaunch talker talker.launch_* in the *Command* field of the form.

.. Listener component:
... Select a name and a description for the `talker` component. Select `Device` as required runtime and check `Is ROS` box.
... The code is already on the device. We simply have to tell rapyuta.io what to run on the device. Make sure to use absolute path of your catkin workspace:

    source /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash && roslaunch listener listener.launch

... No other parameters or topics need to be specified. rapyuta.io will expose the `/telemetry` topic here from the cloud via the cloud bridge.

[start=6]
6. Click on submit. After this, rapyuta.io will process and prepare the package for future deployments. If everything is OK you should see the
status indicator as green on the package information page.

== Deploying the package
There are two ways of deploying a package: using the rapyuta.io console UI or using the link:../rapyuta_io_sdk/sdk_docs.html[rapyuta.io SDK]

=== Deploy the package from the rapyuta.io console UI
1. On the left bar, go to the *Catalog* tab and click on the package you just created.
2. Click on *Deploy package*.
3. We do not need to select the plan, as we only have one. Click on *Get devices*. After some seconds, your online devices should appear. Then, click *Continue*.

image::ros_pub_sub/dep_1.png["Devices available for the deployment."]

[start=4]
4. For the `talker` component, nothing has to be done. For the `listener`, select the device you want to use.
5. Also on the `listener` component, add two `ROS Setup Scripts` (the order is important):

    /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
    /opt/rapyuta/catkin/devel/setup.bash

6. Click on create deployment.

image::ros_pub_sub/dep_2.png["Selecting runtime and adding ROS Setup Scripts."]

The deployment status indicator will blink yellow for some seconds. Once the deployment is finished, it will become green.

To check that everything is working, you can SSH into your device and do:


    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    rostopic echo /telemetry


You should see "Hello world" messages with a timestamp attached at approximately 10 Hz.


=== Deploy the package from the link:../rapyuta_io_sdk/sdk_docs.html[rapyuta.io SDK]

[source,python]
from rapyuta_io import Client
client = Client()
package_id = 'my_package_id'    # change with package_id you want to deploy
plan_id = 'my_plan_id'          # change with the plan_id you want to deploy
auth_token = 'my_auth_token'    # change with your auth_token
pkg = client.get_package(package_id=package_id, plan_id=plan_id, auth_token=auth_token)
deployment = pkg.provision(deployment_id=deployment_id)
deployment_info = pkg.get_deployment_info(deployment['deployment_id'])
