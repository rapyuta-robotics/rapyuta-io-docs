== Introduction
This functionality enables device to push metric data to rapyuta.io and visualize the collected data
 in Web UI. This communication channel is different from what is used to send control commands to
 device.

== Metric Collection
The metric collection feature can be used to collect any telemetry data that is being published by a
 *ROS topic*. We are working on developing more input plugins.

To enable collection of metrics on the device and storage on rapyuta.io, you must change the
 subscriber settings of device.

. Verify that your telemetry node is running and publishing data.
. Go to *Devices* tab and click on your device.
. Go to *Monitor* tab in your device details page.
. Subscribe to the ROS topics you wish to store and visualize.

Your device metric collector will start pushing this data to rapyuta.io. To learn how to visualize
it, go to the next section.

== Graphs and Dashboards
You can go to Web UI to see the data being collected. You can choose among various plotting
 options based on the type of data being published. You can also add multiple graph cells to your
 *Dashboard*. The configured dashboard is saved for every user and can be shared among his groups.

To setup your dashboard:

. Go to *Devices* tab and click on your device.
. Go to *Monitor* tab in your device details page.
. Subscribe to the ROS topics you wish to graph out.
. Click on *Add Cell* and select *Graph*. A graph cell will be added to page.
. Click on *Edit* from the top right menu and then click on *Add Query*.
. Select the metric name you subscribed to and the graph type and click on *OK*.
. The graph cell will start showing plotted data.
