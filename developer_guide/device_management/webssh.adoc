== Introduction
The secure shell (SSH) is the industry standard that provides a secure connection to a system.
 Device Manager provides SSH access to the device using reverse ssh tunnel, thus you do not need
 to expose SSH ports on your device and compromise security. You can issue small commands, test
 some code, check system logs and similar operation to debug your applications.

== Start WebSSH session
To start a SSH session to your device, you need to ensure that your device is online and has ssh
 service. Just go to *SSH* tab in your device details page and your SSH session will be initiated.
