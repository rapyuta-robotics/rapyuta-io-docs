== Introduction
The Device Manager provides SSH access to a connected device using reverse ssh tunnel so that you do not need
 to expose SSH ports on your device network and compromise security. 
 This browser-based terminal is a full-featured TTY that could be used to check system logs or debug your applications.

== Start WebSSH session
To start an SSH session to your device, you need to ensure that your device is online and has ssh service.
Visit the *SSH* tab in your device details page and your SSH session will be initiated.
