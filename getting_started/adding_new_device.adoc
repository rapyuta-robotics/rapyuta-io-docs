=== Setup your device
Paste and run the device setup link on a terminal to the device (using for instance serial TTY or SSH). This will start setting up rapyuta.io device client. 

[NOTE]
The device setup link expires after 10 minutes. Click on *Token* in the UI to generate the link again.

If the setup is completed successfully, your device will appear as online (green) on the rapyuta.io console UI. This is all you need to do to add your device
to rapyuta.io. You can now manage your device from rapyuta.io console UI.

[IMPORTANT]
In case of any error, please copy the output of the terminal and contact Rapyuta Robotics support.
