= Device metric collection and visualization

== Introduction
This functionality enables a device to push metric data to rapyuta.io and visualizes the collected data in the rapyuta.op console UI. This communication
channel is different from the one used to send control commands to the device.

== Metric collection
The metric collection feature can be used to collect any telemetry data that is being published by a ROS topic. To enable collection of metrics on the
device and storage on rapyuta.io, you must change the subscriber settings of the device.

. Create a ROS node on your device to publish telemetry.

    rostopic pub -r 1 /test_topic std_msgs/Float32 5.0

. Go to the *Devices* tab and click on your device.
. Go to the *Monitor* tab on your device details page.
. You should be able to see the list of ROS topics being published. Try refreshing the screen if you cannot.
. Click on the *Subscribe* button to subscribe to the ROS topics you wish to store and visualize.
. Your device metric collector will start pushing this data to rapyuta.io. To learn how to visualize it, go to the next section.


== Graphs and dashboards
You can go to the rapyuta.io console UI to see the data being collected. You can choose among various plotting options based on the type of data being
published. You can also add multiple graph cells to your dashboard. The configured dashboard is saved for every user and can be shared among his groups.

To set up your dashboard:

. Go to the *Devices* tab and click on your device.
. Go to the *Monitor* tab on your device details page.
. Subscribe to the ROS topics you wish to graph out.
. Click on the *Add Cell* button and select *Graph*. A graph cell will be added to the page.
. On the top right menu, click on the *Edit* button and then click on *Add Query*.
. Select the metric name you subscribed to and the graph type and click on *OK*.
. The graph cell will start showing plotted data.

Metrics are stored in a time series database, allowing you to plot the metrics over time. You can apply mean, median, count, min, standard deviation, etc.
functions to the data and group it into time intervals. 

The supported visualization types are line, stacked, and step-plot. You can plot multiple metrics in one chart and also add multiple charts.
