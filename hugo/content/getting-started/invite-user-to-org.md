The admin of an organization can invite users, who belong to the same
organization as that of the admin, to use rapyuta.io

To invite or add users to your organization, you will follow the below
instructions:

1. On left navigation bar, click **ORGANIZATION**. The panel displays
   information such as the name of your organization, its official website,
   location and a list of users.
2. On **Users** tab, enter a valid email address of the user you want to
   invite to the organization. Make sure that the user belongs to the same
   organization as you are in.
3. Click **ADD USER**.

The newly invited user is added to the existing list of **USERS**. Initially,
the state of the user is **Invited**. The invited user will receive an email to
accept the invite to join the organization on rapyuta.io.

changes to **Activated**.
