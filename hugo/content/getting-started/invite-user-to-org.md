The admin of an organization can invite users belonging to the same
organization to explore rapyuta.io from **Organization** panel. The admin
will have to provide the email address of the user they want to invite.
The user, thus invited, will receive an invitation email with rapyuta.io
console URL. The user will then have to register or sign up on rapyuta.io

Once the user signs into rapyuta.io, the userâ€™s status changes to ***Activated***
from ***Invited***.

***TO DO***: Describe the workflow of adding a user to organization with images.
