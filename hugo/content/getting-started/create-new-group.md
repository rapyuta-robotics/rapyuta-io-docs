A [group](/core-concepts/resource-user-group) is a collection of arbitrary number of users
belonging to the same organisation. To create a new group, follow these steps:

1. Click **USERS & GROUPS** on left navigation bar.
2. Click **CREATE NEW GROUP**.
3. In the **Group Name** box, enter a name for the group.
4. Click **CONTINUE**.

If you see an error that says the name you provided is already used,
enter a different name for the group.

You have successfully created a group. To add/remove users
(belonging to the same organisation), follow the steps:

1. Select a group to which you want to add users to.
2. On **Users** tab, under **ADD USER TO GROUP**, enter a user's email address
   in the **Email address** box.
3. Click **ADD USER**.
4. In the **EXISTING USERS** list, click **Remove** against the user you want
   to remove from the group.
