The admin of an organization can remove a user from rapyuta.io.

1. On the left navigation bar, click **ORGANIZATION**. The panel will display information
   such as the name of your organization, its official website, location and a list of users.
2. On **Users** tab, search for the user you want to remove.
   Also ensure that the user is in **Invited** state.
