Consider two projects, *example-0* and *example-2*. You would want to
switch between *example-0* and *example-2*.

To switch from *example-0* to *example-2*, you will follow the below instructions:

1. Click on *example-0* located at the top left corner of the rapyuta.io page.
   ![project zero](/images/getting-started/organization/project/switch-projs/example-0.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
2. Select *example-2* from the list of available projects.
   ![switch-proj](/images/getting-started/organization/project/switch-projs/switch-proj.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
3. Now you are in *example-2* project namespace.
   ![project two](/images/getting-started/organization/project/switch-projs/example-2.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
