Applying configuration parameters to a device (or robots) consists of
three primary steps:

1. Define labels for the device.
2. Create configuration.
3. Apply configuration parameters (created in step 2) to devices.

## Defining labels for devices
You can tag your devices with as many labels as you need. Labels are
key-value pairs that help you associate configuration parameters with
a group of devices or a particular device. Make sure that the keys of
all the labels of a device are *unique*.

To add a new label to a device, select the device from the **DEVICES**
panel on the left navigation bar.

1. On the **Details** tab, find for the **LABELS** section.
2. Enter the key of the label to the left of the **:**     
   In this case, the key is ***country***
3. Enter the value of the label to the right of **:**     
   In this case, the value is ***Japan***
4. Click **Add label**

You can also modify existing labels by changing their keys or/and
values and clicking **Save**.
