Any user in **Activated** state can create a new project. The *creator* of the
project can alone add or remove users from the project.

To create a new project, you will follow the below instructions:

1. On the left navigation bar, click **PROJECTS**. You will view a dashboard,
   which enlists all of the current projects in your organization.
2. Click **CREATE NEW PROJECT**.
   ![Create new project](/images/getting-started/organization/project/proj-dashboard.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
3. Provide a name for the project say `example-2`
   {{% notice info %}}
   A projectâ€™s name is 3 to 15 characters in length, and contains lowercase
   alphabets, digits and hyphen (-).
   {{% /notice %}}
   ![Enter project's name](/images/getting-started/organization/project/proj-name.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
4. Click **CONTINUE**.

The newly created project appears in the list of current projects on the
dashboard. The list displays the name of the project, its creator and the
valid action for the project.
