## What is rapyuta.io

rapyuta.io is a platform that enables robotics solution development by providing the necessary software infrastructure and facilitating the interaction between multiple stakeholders who contribute to the solution development.

rapyuta.io is a platform-as-a-service providing managed cloud services that solve technical and production challenges of building, provisioning, running, and iterating on distributed robotic applications.



It enables developers to develop robot enabled solutions that can be more complex, encompass a variety of robots, scale further and operate in multiple geographic locations.

Get started with a [quick walkthrough](/quick-walkthrough/). 



## Vision

Our mission is to empower lives with connected machines. Machine - from
robots, automation equipment, servers to network devices - connected and
coordinated in a streamlined way to increase efficiency and reduce
the human effort in 3K - kitanai (dirty), kiken (dangerous),
kitsui (demanding) - work.


To make these machines more accessible, we follow the cloud robotics
model defined as


> Cloud Robotics is a model enabling self-service, elastic, and ubiquitous access to a shared pool of robotics resources with open interfaces.


This model is inspired by the cloud computing model [1] is a broader
definition of Cloud Robotics compared to the Cloud-connected Robotics
definition by Kuffner[2].

## Our Origins

Our journey on Cloud Robotics started with [RoboEarth](http://roboearth.ethz.ch/), an EU-funded project 
from 2010 to 2014,  whose goal is to create an **internet for robots**, where 
robots could enjoy both a **shared** (via a common knowledge base) and an **extended** (via servers in a data center) brain.



The founding members of what would become Rapyuta Robotics made up the
ETH Zurich team of the RoboEarth project. Our partners included six
universities and the Dutch electronics giant Philips. For more details
on our prior work, have a look at the following papers and videos:
