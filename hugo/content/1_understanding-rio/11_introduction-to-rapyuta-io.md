## What is rapyuta.io

rapyuta.io is a platform that provides the necessary development environment for robotics developer to create, deploy, and manage robotics applications by using the Robotics Operating System (ROS) framework with cloud service.

It also provides platform-as-a-service to manage cloud services that solve technical and production challenges of building, provisioning, running, and iterating on distributed robotic applications.

It enables developers to develop robot-enabled solutions that can be more complex, encompass a variety of robots, scale further and operate in multiple geographic locations.
