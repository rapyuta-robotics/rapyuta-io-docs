## March 03
Welcome to the March 03, 2021 release of the rapyuta.io platform. There
are significant updates in this release that we hope you will like.


#### Improvements
* **New Documentation structure**

     The rapyuta.io platform documentation is completely revamped with the following improved changes.

     * The document is divided into multiple sections (Introduction, Getting Started, How To Guides, and Core concepts) and added a collapsable TOC to serve the purpose of  users.
     * Improved search mechanism in the document for better findability and an enhanced user experience.
     * Included FAQ and Troubleshooting sections to address user issues.
     * Allowed user contribution to the content by adding inline **Make a contribution** button.

* **Updated Ports for Device recorder** 

    The port for the ROS Bag recorder (the component responsible for collecting ROS bags in a device) has been changed from 9001 to 9010 and uses 8008. Avoid using these ports in your applications.

* Minor improvements related to historical logs and parameters UI
