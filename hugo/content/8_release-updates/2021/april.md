## April 07
Welcome to the April 07, 2021 release of the rapyuta.io platform. There
are significant updates in this release that we hope you will like.
 
#### Feature
 
* **Edit and Update Build**
 
    The rapyuta.io platform allows you to edit and update an existing build. Note that for the updates to be reflected in the build, you must trigger the build. For more information, [click here](/3_how-tos/33_software-development/331_create-builds/#updating-the-build).
 
#### Bugfixes
* Clicking on the **Show Build** button supposed to take you to the **Build Details** page, but instead, it was taking you to the **Development>Builds** page. After the fix, the **Show Build** button takes you to the appropriate page.
 
 
#### SDK
 
**rapyuta.io Python SDK [0.23.0](/3_how-tos/35_tooling_and_debugging/rapyuta-io-python-sdk/#installation) released**.
 
* Added SDK support for editing or updating an existing build.
