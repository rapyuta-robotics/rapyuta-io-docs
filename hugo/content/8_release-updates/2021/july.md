## July 07
Welcome to the June 07, 2021 release of the rapyuta.io platform. There
are some significant updates in this release that we hope you will like.
 

#### Improvement

* Added a mountpath for the debug environment.
* The default ROS version while adding a device is set to **Melodic** and **Use docker compose as default runtime** is checked by default. For more information, [click here](/3_how-tos/32_device-management/321_onboarding-a-device/#register-a-new-device)




#### Bugfix
