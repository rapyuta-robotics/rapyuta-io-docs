## June 09
Welcome to the June 09, 2021 release of the rapyuta.io platform. There
are some significant updates in this release that we hope you will like.
 

#### Improvement

* **ROS Master Log Purging**

    The rapyuta.io platform maintains 1 GB of disk usage for the ROS master logs. If the disk usage exceeds the default limit of 1 GB, the platform purges the older logs to maintain the default limit. For more information, [click here](/5_deep-dives/51_managing-devices/513_device-config-variables/).


#### Bugfix

* The download link to download a log file under the **Manage** tab is fixed now.
