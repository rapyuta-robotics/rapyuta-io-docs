## June 08
Welcome to the June 08, 2021 release of the rapyuta.io platform. There
are some significant updates in this release that we hope you will like.
 

#### Improvement

* **ROS Master Log Purging**

    The rapyuta.io platform maintains 1 GB of disk usage for the ROS master logs. If the disk usage exceeds the default limit of 1GB, the platform purges the older logs to maintain the default limit. For more information, [click here](/5_deep-dives/51_managing-devices/513_device-config-variables/).


#### Bugfixe

* The download link to download a log file under the **Manage** tab is fixed now.
