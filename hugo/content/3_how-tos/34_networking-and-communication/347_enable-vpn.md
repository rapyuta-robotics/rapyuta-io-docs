## VPN Overview

rapyuta.io supports the native VPN. It now provides the capability to connect devices and device deployments in a warehouse with deployments running in the cloud and vice-versa. It will also allow device (robot/edge) addressability in the warehouse for debugging and maintenance.

You can use the CLI to enable VPN on projects, devices, and cloud deployments.
