## Deployment Logs

rapyuta.io provides searchable logs (**historical logs**) for
components, executables, and associated cloud bridges of deployment both in the cloud or on a device.
Additionally, for components deployed on the cloud, rapyuta.io offers a
to stream (**live logs**) and follow stdout/stderr.



Add a ROS package to rapyuta.io, which will have a component with
cloud runtime. It will publish the ROS topic *_/telemetry_* with **Maximum** **QoS** as well as print debug information to **stdout**. Deploy the package on the cloud, and name the deployment as

**ROS publisher exclusive deployment**


1. On the left navigation bar, click **Development>Deployments**.

2. Select a specific deployment whose logs you want to view or analyze.

   In this example, select **ROS publisher exclusive deployment**.

3. On the deployment's **DETAILS** tab, ensure the green progress bar is at **Succeeded** and **Status: Running** point.



### Stdout Logs

To view or analyze the corresponding deployment logs, click **Historical Logs**.

![Deployment detials page](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/deployment-hist-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)



The historical deployment logs is displayed, where you can view the log’s timestamp,

its component name and executable name, and its information or message.

![Historical logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/hist-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)



You can use the toggle button to filter the logs based on the timestamp, component, or executables available in the deployment.

![Filters for Historical logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/filter-hist-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)



You can select a specific **component-executable** combination to view its corresponding logs.
You may also select multiple such combinations. If you select only a component’s name, you will
view all the logs generated by all of the executables of that component. If no component is selected,
you will view all the logs generated by all of the components that are deployed. For example,
the historical logs of only the **Talker** component are shown below.

![component-executable combination](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/cmpnt-exec-combo.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)



You can choose to view logs from within a time range.
But, ensure the time slice is neither in the past from the start time of a deployment nor in the future from now. You will be able to view
logs up to **seven days** in the past if a deployment has been running till now.



![Time Interval](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/time-range.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)





You can also download historical logs of a deployment as a **.log** file by clicking the download button.

![Download logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/download-button.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)



The **Download Historical logs** page appears. Clicking on the button with the download icon, the **Paginated Download Logs** modal should appear. If the logs are less than 100,000 lines, they are directly downloaded, and the modal is not shown.

![Download button](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/download-lines-button.png?classes=border,shadow&width=30pc)  



You may want to refresh the logs by clicking the refresh button.

![Refresh logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/refresh-button.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)



Any errors or exceptions that occur while logs are being generated are redirected to **stderr** output window, but otherwise,
a valid logs output is displayed in **stdout** window.

### Indexed Logs

To view the corresponding deployment logs in real-time, click **Live Logs** tab. They are streamed in a terminal-like window and can be useful to view and debug your application in the cloud as it generates new logs. The rapyuta.io platform allows you to view the live 

It is similar to the **tail -f** functionality one is used to in a UNIX terminal console.

![Live Logs tab](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/realtime-logs/deployment-live-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)





The **Live Logs** tab allows you to do the following.



* View the real-time logs of the deployed components and the associated cloud bridges.



* Download the live log details  to your local machine by clicking the download icon.



* Search for a specific phrase in the continuous log stream by entering the phrase inside the **Search** box. If there is a match, all occurrences of matching patterns of the phrase are highlighted.



* View logs in the full-screen mode by clicking on the **fullscreen** icon that is located at the top right corner of the terminal-like window.

## Device Logs

By default, device logs are not collected until you explicitly subscribe to a
ROS topic in case of ROS deployments.

Before viewing device logs, it is necessary to have the ROS Master up and running.
Add a _ROS Publisher_ package that has a _Talker_ component with device runtime.
It publishes */telemetry* ROS topic with **High** **QoS**.

1. On the left navigation bar, click **Devices>All Devices**.
2. Select a device whose device logs you want to view. In this example,
   _ROS Publisher Subscriber Device_ is selected.
3. Under **Logs** tab, to subscribe to a ROS topic, click **Subscribe** against the topic. In this example, the topic `/telemetry` is subscribed.
   Ensure the status of the subscribed topic(s) is **Subscribed** and is highlighted
   in green.

![To subscribe](/images/core-concepts/logging/device-logs/yet-to-subscribe.png?classes=border,shadow&width=60pc)

Once you subscribe to a topic, the device logs are displayed in the
_logging area_ (a terminal-like window).

Initially, you will see the latest 500 logs in the logging area. As you scroll
up to the top of the terminal window, the previous 500 logs are displayed. You may continue scrolling up till all the logs are exhausted.

![Logging Area](/images/core-concepts/logging/device-logs/logging-terminal-window.png?classes=border,shadow&width=60pc)

To get updated logs, scroll down to the bottom of the logging area, and then
click **Get recent logs**.

To switch between the topics, click the drop-down list (at the top-left corner
of the logging area) and select one of the subscribed topics. A tick mark against the topic `/telemetry` indicates that you are currently viewing the logs belonging to `/telemetry`.

You can search the logs for matching phrases using the **Search** bar. All
occurrences of a match are highlighted.

If you prefer to view the timestamp of every log displayed in the logging area,
select **Show timestamps** checkbox.

Topics such as `/rosout` and `/rosout_agg` are already available for a
ROS-based device.



 ## Build Logs


  Build logs are generated when rapyuta.io converts the
  source code of a git repository into a runnable docker image.

  To view build logs of a build on rapyuta.io,
  follow these steps:

  

  1. On the left navigation bar, click **Development>Builds**.  

  2. Select a build from the build list page. Click on **SHOW MORE** and go to **Build history** tab.  

     The tab displays the time of build creation, the author who created it, the build status, and the error string.  

  ![build Logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/build-logs/build-history-view-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=60pc)     

  3. To view details of the git repository such as repository’s name, commit number, commit message, and the git hosting platform, 

     click **View details/logs**.

  4. Click on **View logs**, to see the build logs.

  5. Build logs are displayed in the logging area (terminal-like window). You may

     scroll up to view the starting logs of the log stream.

  

  Once all of the build logs are generated, the status indicator greys out and you'll see a **Logs streaming ended** status (top left corner of the terminal window). If you see an error and the logs are not being generated,
  click **Refresh**.

## Routed Network Logs

Viewing routed network logs is the same as viewing any component logs.

To view or analyze the corresponding routed network logs, do the following.

 1. click **Historical Logs** and under **Source** and check the routed network for which you want to view the logs.
