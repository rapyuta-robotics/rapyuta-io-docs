## Uploading Files from Device

You can upload files present on the device to rapyuta.io. 

It allows you to:

* **Save** logs for future reference. The logs are saved to the

  cloud storage.

* **Process** and **analyze** logs for insights as per your requirements.

* Copy files for further debugging

You can upload files by clicking on the **Upload** button on the device's **Manage** tab.

A list of statuses indicates the progress of an ongoing upload.

They are:

* **In Progress**: uploading a log file (to the cloud storage) is underway.

* **Failed**: uploading a log file failed due to an error.

* **Complete**: uploading a log file (to the storage) is succeeded.

#### Viewing Uploaded Log Files



The rapyuta.io platform displays all the uploaded log files in a paginated view. You can customize the number of log files to be displayed by selecting the number of files per page drop-down menu. You can also directly jump to the page number by typing the page number in the **Go to** field.
