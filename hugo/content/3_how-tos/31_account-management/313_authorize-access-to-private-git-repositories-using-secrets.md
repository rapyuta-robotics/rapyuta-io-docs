You can create packages using the source code from a private git repository. A source secret allows rapyuta.io to access a private git repository or a git repository with a self-assigned or untrusted SSL certificate.

> * The rapyuta.io platform uses git version 2.16.6.
> * While cloning a git repository, ensure that you provide the appropriate protocol (HTTP/HTTPS). The HTTP to HTTPS redirection does not work while cloning the repositories.


## Creating source secret

To create a source secret for the private git repository, do the following:

1. On the left navigation bar, click **Account>Secrets**.

2. Click **ADD NEW SECRET**.

3. Under **SELECT SECRET TYPE**, click **Source secret**.

4. In the **Name** box, enter a name for the source secret.

   For instance, you may name the source secret as *_source-secret-name_*. Ensure that the name should be no greater than 253 characters. It must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or hyphen -, and it must begin and end with an alphanumeric character.

5. From the **Authentication** drop-down menu, select either one of the following.

   * **Basic authentication**: Select this option if you want to authenticate a user with either a git access token or username and password.

   * **SSH authentication**: Select this option if you want to authenticate a user with a private SSH key of a git repository.
   
6. If you select **Basic Authentication** from the **Authentication Type** drop-down list, you can select either of the following authentication methods.

   * **Password**: If you have selected this option, type your git username and password in the **Username**, and **Password** fields respectively.

   * **Token**: If you have selected this option, type the corresponding git access token in the **Token** field.

7. If you select **SSH Authentication** from the **Authentication Type** drop-down list, type the SSH key of your git repository in the **SSH Key** fields.
