### Testing Preview
Labels are key-value pairs that help you associate configuration parameters with a group of devices or a particular device.

You can tag your devices with multiple labels. 
{{%notice note%}}
The keys of all the device labels must be **unique**.
{{%/notice%}}

## Managing Labels

1. To add a new label:

    a. In the left navigation bar, select **Devices > All Devices**. 
      A list of devices is displayed.

    b. Select a device and click the **Details** tab.
    
    c. Under **Labels**, enter the **key** and **value**.   
      For example, if the key is **Country**, the value can be **Japan**.
    
    d.Click **Add label**. The labels are added to the device.

2. To modify an existing label, edit the keys or/and values.

3. To delete a label, click on the delete icon.
