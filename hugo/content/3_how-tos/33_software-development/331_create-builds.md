## Creating Build Using the Catkin or Docker Recipe 

To create a build using the Catkin or Docker recipe: 

1. In the rapyuta.io console, on the left navigation bar, click **Development > Builds**.

2. Click **ADD NEW BUILD**.

3. In the **Create new build** dialog, under **Git info**, enter:

  | Field | Description |
  | --- | -------|
  | Name | Enter a build name. The name should only contain alphanumeric characters, underscore and hyphen. It should not start with a digit and the length should be between 3 and 75  characters.|
  | Build Recipe | Select **Catkin** or **Docker**.|
  | Repository (URL) | Enter the URL of the git repository from which you want to create a build. For example, `https://github.com/rapyuta/io_tutorials`.|
  | Branch | Enter the branch name of the repository for the build. <br> **Note:**<br>In the Branch field, you can also provide any Git reference as valid input. For example, Commit ID, Tag name, or Branch name. If you donâ€™t specify any branch name in the Branch field, then the default branch name of the repository is considered. |
  | Private Git | Enable the **Private Git** toggle button if it is a private git repository. Additionally, select the **Credentials** from the dropdown list. To create a secret for the repository, see [Create a Source Secret](/how-to-guides/account-management/setup-private-git-access/#creating-source-secret). |
  | Context Directory | Enter the directory path to create the build.|

4. Click **Next**.
   
5. Under **Build Info**, enter:
   
  | Field | Description |
  | --- | -------|
  | Architecture | Select the processor architecture for the build. The available options are; **arm32v7**, **arm32v7**, or **amd64**.|
  | Dockerfile Path (applicable only for Docker recipe) | Enter the path of the docker file that contains the source code. The docker file path is relative to the Context Directory field.  |
  | Has ROS Components (applicable only for Docker recipe) | Enable if the build has ROS components. |
  | Has Simulation | Enable the **Has Simulation** toggle button if the build has a simulation.|
  | ROS Version | Select either **Kinetic** or **Melodic**. <br> {{%notice note%}} As Kinetic has reached the EOL, it is suggested to select **Melodic** as the ROS version  while creating a build.
  {{%/notice%}}|
  | Add Parameter (applicable only for Catkin recipe) | Select this option to add ROS parameter to the build. For more information about adding parameters, see  [Builds: ROS Support](/5_deep-dives/52_software-development/523_ros-support-for-builds).|
  
6. Click **Next**.
  
5. rapyuta.io platform allows you to push and save the build image to an external docker registry or to pull an image from a private repository. Under **Docker Secret**, enter:

  | Field | Description |
  | --- | -------|
  | Docker Pull Secret (applicable only for Docker recipe)| Enable and select the secret for the repository if you want to pull a secured docker image to the docker file. You can enable this option if the docker file requires a base image from the private registry. To create a secret for the repository, see [Create a Secret](/how-to-guides/account-management/setup-private-docker-registry/#creating-a-docker-secret).|
  | Docker Push Secret | Enable if you want to push the build image to a private registry and select the secret for the repository. To create a secret for the repository, see [Create a Secret](/how-to-guides/account-management/setup-private-docker-registry/#creating-a-docker-secret).|
  | Image Repository | Enter the URL of the private repository where you want to push and save the image for later usage. For example, ```docker.io/your-username/repo-name```.|
  | Push Secret | Select the secret from the dropdown list.  To create a secret for the repository, see [Create a Source Secret](/how-to-guides/account-management/setup-private-git-access/#creating-source-secret). |
  | Trigger Name | Enter a name for the trigger. This is used to identify the build requests. |
  | Tag Name | The tag name is an optional field and can be used as a docker tag in the external docker registry. |
  | Same as Trigger Name | Select this checkbox if you wish to use the **Trigger Name** as the **Tag Name**. |

 7. Click **Next**. The build is created.

 * Click **Show Build** to view the build details.  To view the build history, select the **Build History** tab. 
 * To view the build progress, select the build in the **Development > Builds** page. 

{{%notice info%}}
The **Build History** tab displays the trigger/tag name added during the build creation. If you haven't added any trigger name to the build, it displays a default trigger name.
{{%/notice%}}

## Viewing Build Details

After you have created a build by either Catkin or Docker recipe, you can view the details of the available builds in your project. 

To view the details of a build: 

1. In the rapyuta.io console, on the left navigation bar, click **Development > Builds**.  
All the available builds of the projects are displayed.

The following table displays the details of the available builds.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Name/ID| Specifies the name of the build.
|Status| Specifies the build status. <ul><li>BuildInProgress: Displays when the build creation process is in progress.</li><li>Complete: Displays when the build creation process has been completed.</li><li>BuildFailed: Displays if the build creation process has failed.</li></ul>
|Started| Provides the time at which the build creation process started.
|Repository| Provides the repository from which the build has been created.
|Action| Allows you to delete, trigger, or clone a build. 

2. To view the details of a particular build, select the build. 
The following operations can be performed on the **Build Details** page:</br>

  * Click **Delete** to delete the build. 
  
{{% notice info %}}
If the build **Status** is *_BuildInProgress_*, you cannot **Delete** the build. Deletion of such builds will fail with the error message: **can't delete the build since its corresponding build request is still in progress**.
{{% /notice %}}

  * Click **Trigger** to trigger a build. 

  * Click **Clone** to clone a build within the same or to different projects. This reduces the time and effort to create a build from scratch.<br>
    **Note:**
    <ul><li>If you want to clone a project within the same project, you must rename the build name.</li>
    <li>If the build that you are cloning has a secret, the rapyuta.io platform also allows you to clone the secret to the destined project or select a different secret that you want to use in the cloned build. From the **Destination** drop-down menu, select the secret that you want to use in the cloned build and click **Clone**.</li>
    <li>The dialog box to clone secret appears only for the builds that have a secret.</li>
    <li>The build creation page appears and allows you to modify the build details. </li>

  * Click **Edit** to update the details of the build.<br>
    **Note:**
    <ul><li> If you provide a branch name in the **Repository** field and provide another branch name in the **Branch** field, the **Branch** field name takes precedence.</li> <li>Docker Pull Secret and Image Repository fields can be updated only for docker build recipe.</li><li>Catkin Parameters can be updated only for catkin build recipe. </li><li> After you edit and update the build, you must trigger the build for the updates to be applied. </ul>

  * Click **More** to view the build details.
