A set of specific units is used to measure the consumption of resources. It determines the charges incurred according to your subscribed plan. The subscription plan is quantified
in terms of the count of add-ons and the pay-as-you-use scheme.

## Pay As You Use

In this scheme, you pay for all of the designated units as you use them.
The units include cloud deployment hours, device deployment hours and
persistent volume.

Device deployment hours is the duration for which you can run your deployments
on your devices through rapyuta.io. If you exhaust the available device deployment hours of your subscribed plan, you will incur an additional
fee for each additional hour.

Cloud deployment hours is the duration for which you can run your deployments
in the cloud through rapyuta.io. Similarly, you will incur an additional fee
per vCPU per hour if you exhaust the available cloud deployment hours of your
subscribed plan.

The following table lists the memory and processing power constraints for cloud
deployment hours. It shows the three tiers of CPU and memory sizes that are available for
you to choose from.

| Tier | vCPU | Memory |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| Low | 1 | 4 |
| Medium | 2 | 8 |
| High | 8 | 32 |

Persistent volume is made available in the form of SSD disks. The available disk
sizes are 32GiB, 64GiB, 128GiB, 256GiB and 512GiB. Volume deployment hours
is the duration for which you run deployments of the ***Persistent Volume*** package
provided by rapyuta.io

## Add-ons

The [Community](/pricing/subscription-plans/#community-plan) and
[Professional](/pricing/subscription-plans/#professional-plan) plans provide
add-ons, which are discrete and countable units. Devices and users are examples of the
available add-ons. You can add or delete users and devices according to your
requirements. The charges incurred on add-ons are added to the estimated bill of the next month.
