On subscribing to one of the plans, you (the admin of organization or
individual user) can access the **Billing** panel. *Billing* aggregates information
on the charges incurred on consumable units, and displays it in
tabular and graphical forms.

The subscription fee is recurring and prepaid. You will be charged monthly on the
first day of the month, that is, the payment receipt is generated at the start of the month. You will receive an email with the payment receipt at the start of every month. The payment receipt shows the subscription fee of the current
month and usage charges of the previous month.

If 80% of the resource limits of the subscribed plan are exhausted, you will be alerted about it by a one-time notification at the top right corner of rapyuta.io dashboard.

* The **ESTIMATED BILL** is calculated based on your estimated usage for the month.
* The **NEXT BILLING DATE** is the date when the credit card will be charged towards
the payment of the final bill including taxes.
* The **PLAN** displays the plan you have subscribed to.
* The donut chart provides you insights into the relative component of any
  *additional usage charges* and *standard subscription charges*. Additional usage indicates the count of
  additional devices, users, cloud deployment hours, device deployment hours and
  volume deployment hours.
* The ***Current Usage*** is the count of units currently being used.
* The ***Included Units*** is the count of units included in the subscribed plan.
* The ***Add-Ons*** is the current count of add-ons you have purchased.
