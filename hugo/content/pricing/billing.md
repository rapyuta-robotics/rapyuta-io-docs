After subscribing to one of the plans, you (admin of organization or
individual user) can access the **Billing** panel. The panel aggregates information
on the charges incurred on various units of measurement and displays it in
tabular and graphical forms.

The **ESTIMATED BILL** is calculated based on the estimated usage for the month.
The **NEXT BILLING DATE** is the date when the credit card will be charged towards
the payment of the estimated bill. The **PLAN** displays the plan you have subscribed
to for your reference. The pie chart like graph depicts the percentage of
*Additional usage charges* and the percentage of *Subscription charges*. It provides
insights into your additional usage cost relative to subscription plan cost.

Additional usage indicates the count of additional units of devices, users,
cloud deployment hours, device deployment hours and volume deployment hours.
The ***Current Usage*** is the count of units currently being used. The ***Included Units***
is the count of units included in the subscribed plan. The ***Add-Ons*** is the count
of devices or users that are added/deleted. Hence, the total available units is the
sum of included units and add-ons.

## Billing Cycle
On subscribing to one of the plans, you will be charged once a month on the first
day of the month. The payment receipt is generated on the first day of every month.
The subscription fee is recurring and prepaid. At the end of the billing cycle,
you (admin of organization or individual user) will receive an email with the
usage statistics and summary. If the resource limits of the subscribed plan are
exhausted, you will be alerted about it by a one-time notification.

If you want to unsubscribe the current plan or upgrade to another plan,
please contact support.
