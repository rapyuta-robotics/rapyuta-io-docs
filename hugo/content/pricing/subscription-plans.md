There is an open [discussion forum](https://forum.rapyuta.io) for
rapyuta.io users, where you can ask clarifying questions, discuss relevant topics,
share knowledge and help others by answering queries about rapyuta.io platform.

You need to be a registered rapyuta.io user to interact in the discussion forum.
Please be *respectful*, *kind* and *empathetic* in your interactions with other
users in the discussion forum.

## Community Plan
As a promotional offer, the community plan provides free resources every
month. This offer is only for a limited time. The free resources are
**100 vCPU-hour cloud deployment** hours and
**500 device deployment hours**.

The current usage percentage is the percentage of included units of
either cloud deployment hours or device deployment hours consumed.
An email notification will be sent when the current usage percentage
is at **60%**, and another one at **90%**. A final email notification is
sent out at **100%** usage at which point your account is **suspended**.

Once the account is suspended, all deployments are stopped and deleted,
and all devices are removed from rapyuta.io completely. Since the
deletion of resources is *irreversible* the deployments and devices cannot
be restored. Consequently, you will lose any information, like logs,
associated with those resources. You can re-activate your account by
adding credit card information on the Billing page after logging into
the platform.

Besides free resources, the plan includes **add-ons**, which are devices
and users. You are allowed to add at most two devices. You can purchase
more add-ons by adding credit card details on the Billing page.
With credit card added, you can also deploy storage volumes for
applications to use.

## Professional Plan

With professional plan, you can get started with rapyuta.io for free for ***seven*** days. On subscribing to the plan, the subscription fee is applied monthly and prorated for partial months. Your credit card will be charged with
the subscription fee at the start of the free trial period. You will be automatically moved to the professional plan once the free trial period ends.
{{% notice note %}}
***Fair use*** during the free 7-day trial period restricts you to *50 cloud deployment hours* and *200 device deployment hours*. If you unsubscribe from the plan before the free trial period ends, the full subscription fee will be refunded. However, you may be charged for additional consumption of resources beyond their fair use before.

## Consumable Items

Device deployment hours, cloud deployment hours, volume deployment hours and add-ons are the consumable items or billable items in rapyuta.io.

You will incur overage charges when you exhaust all deployment hours of your subscribed plan. These additional charges are levied only for what you use.

{{% notice info %}}
In the case of volume deployment hours, rapyuta.io provides SSD disks as persistent storage volumes. The disks are of ***32GiB***, ***64GiB***, ***128GiB***, ***256GiB*** and ***512GiB*** sizes.
{{% /notice %}}

Add-ons are discrete and countable items such as devices added to rapyuta.io or active users of rapyuta.io. You can purchase add-ons to increase the available
limits on devices and users provided by your subscribed plan.

To add or remove add-ons in rapyuta.io:

1. Click **Add/Remove add-ons** adjacent to the add-on name.

2. Increase or decrease the count of devices or users by using the arrows.
3. Click **UPDATE**.
