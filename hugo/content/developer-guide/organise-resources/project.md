## Create New Project
Any user in **Activated** state can create a new project. The *creator* of the
project can alone add or remove users from the project.

To create a new project, you will follow the below instructions:

1. On the left navigation bar, click **PROJECTS**. You will view a dashboard,
   which enlists all the current rapyuta.io projects in your organization. The list displays the name of the project, its creator and the valid action for the project.
2. Click **CREATE NEW PROJECT**.

3. Provide a name for the project say `example-2`
   {{% notice info %}}
   A projectâ€™s name is 3 to 15 characters in length, and contains lowercase
   alphabets, digits and hyphen (-).
   {{% /notice %}}
   ![Enter project's name](/images/getting-started/organization/project/proj-name.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
4. Click **CONTINUE**.

The newly created project appears in the list of current projects on the
dashboard. A project is highlighted in red if you are either the project's creator or a member of the project.

The admin of the organization can see all the rapyuta.io projects that are created for the organization, while the other users can see only the projects that they are a member of.

## Switch Between Projects
Consider two projects, *example-0* and *example-3*. You would want to
switch between *example-0* and *example-3*.

To switch from *example-0* to *example-3*, you will follow the below instructions:

1. Click on *example-0* located at the top left corner of the rapyuta.io page.
   ![project zero](/images/getting-started/organization/project/switch-projs/example-0.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
2. Select *example-3* from the list of available projects.
   ![switch-proj](/images/getting-started/organization/project/switch-projs/switch-proj.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
3. Now you are in *example-3* project namespace.
   ![project three](/images/getting-started/organization/project/switch-projs/example-3.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
