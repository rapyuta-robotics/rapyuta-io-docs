## Create New Project
Any user in **Activated** state can create a new project. The *creator* of the
project can alone add or remove users from the project.

To create a new project, you will follow the below instructions:

1. On the left navigation bar, click **PROJECTS**. You will view a dashboard,
   which enlists all the current rapyuta.io projects in your organization. The list displays the name of the project, its creator and the valid action for the project.
2. Click **CREATE NEW PROJECT**.

3. Provide a name for the project say `example-2`
   {{% notice info %}}
   A project’s name is 3 to 15 characters in length, and contains lowercase
   alphabets, digits and hyphen (-).
   {{% /notice %}}
   ![Enter project's name](/images/getting-started/organization/project/proj-name.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
4. Click **CONTINUE**.

The newly created project appears in the list of current projects on the
dashboard. A project is highlighted in red if you are either the project's creator or a member of the project.

The admin of the organization can see all the rapyuta.io projects that are created for the organization, while the other users can see only the projects that they are a member of.

## Switch Between Projects
Consider two projects, *example-0* and *example-3*. You would want to
switch between *example-0* and *example-3*.

To switch from *example-0* to *example-3*, you will follow the below instructions:

1. Click on *example-0* located at the top left corner of the rapyuta.io page.
   ![project zero](/images/getting-started/organization/project/switch-projs/example-0.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
2. Select *example-3* from the list of available projects.
   ![switch-proj](/images/getting-started/organization/project/switch-projs/switch-proj.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
3. Now you are in *example-3* project namespace.
   ![project three](/images/getting-started/organization/project/switch-projs/example-3.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

## Delete Existing Project
## Add/Remove Users From Project
A project’s creator can alone add other users to the project.

{{% notice note %}}
All users in a rapyuta.io project belong to the same organization as that of its creator.
{{% /notice %}}

To add a user to a project, you will follow the below instructions:

1. On the left navigation bar, click **PROJECTS** to view the projects dashboard.
2. Select the project to which you want to add a user.
3. Under **Users** tab, select the name of the user from the drop down menu. Ensure that the user you are adding is in **Activated** state.
4. Click **ADD USER**.
   ![Add user to project](/images/getting-started/organization/project/add-user-to-proj.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
5. The name of the user and their email address is added to the list of **EXISTING USERS**.
