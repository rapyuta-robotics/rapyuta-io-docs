## Cloud Bridge
The cloud bridge is responsible for implicitly establishing a communication
channel between two or more ROS environments. It is an application-level bridge
that offers many compelling features to ROS developers.

ROS takes a fully connected graph approach for connecting all relevant ROS nodes.
While this works on a local network, it is suboptimal over a WAN link where it
could lead to a waste of precious bandwidth and run the risk of compromising
latency and reliability. We use an application level whitelist-based approach
to select exactly what information (topic/service/actions) flows over the Internet.
The bridge taps into ROS’s internal mechanics to automate ROS message schema
detection and metadata, it also manages dead peers, remote announcements and
configuration thereby alleviating the need for complex configuration, build steps,
and ROS message definition management.

In a typical ROS application, not all ROS topics are equal, some are more
relevant than others. For instance, some applications would prefer losing
few telemetry messages while ensuring they arrive within a reasonable time bound.
On the other hand, there might be less frequent but application-critical messages
that are required to be delivered. The cloud bridge provides parameters for
configuring bounds on delays, QoS, TTL per topic. Additionally, it is possible
to configure protocol optimisations, load-balancing, selectable compression,
connection pooling, and reassembly. These parameters help reduce routing overheads,
maintain ordering (per-topic), reduce payload size (up to 80% under
certain conditions for sparse messages like a PointCloud), and allow
for horizontal scale out (on services/actions).

Further, each deployment gets a dedicated endpoint to cater to the needs of
that particular deployment. Additionally, the endpoint is randomised and has a
unique set of encryption keys and credentials to ensure security.

If in the ROS Service logs you experience the error: ***incoming connection failed: unable to receive data from sender, check sender's logs for details***, please ignore it. The error message is generated by ROS internally as a side effect of the sniffing done by the cloud bridge so as to determine metadata related to ROSmsg type for the service. It has no other effects on your code and/or the code's functionality, and you can safely ignore it.

## Inbound Interfaces
A deployment of a package may depend on a deployment of another package. If you
intend to add a deployment of another package as a dependent deployment of the
current package, the inbound ROS interface could be a:

* ROS topic that a dependent deployment publishes to the current package.
* ROS service or ROS action of the dependent deployment, and the current package
  is allowed to call that ROS action and/or ROS service.

## Multi-robot Support
Topics, services, and actions are the primary way ROS nodes communicate
with each other in a ROS (in this document when we refer to ROS we imply
ROS1) environment.

Topics, services, and actions are implicitly typed by the message
definition used to declare the topic/service/action. For instance, a
robot’s sensors may publish information about itself on a topic called
***/odom*** and use the message *nav_msgs/Odometry*, at the same time the
onboard controller may receive control commands for its motion on
***/cmd_vel*** of the type  *geometry_msgs/Twist*. This pattern may sound
familiar to ROS users and is used in the popular *move_base* package.

When this paradigm needs to be applied to multiple robots, the often
used approach is to namespace each of these topics by the ***\<robot_name\>***
so you get topics like ***/\<robot_name\>/odom*** and ***/\<robot_name\>/cmd_vel***
To use this in practice with existing ROS tooling requires a careful
juggling of configuration management, setting intricate parameters and
some clever tricks with topic remap and/or roslaunch. ROS works well
within a single robot system and you can still enjoy all the benefits of
the tools, packages, and community. While working with multiple robots
due to the design limitations of ROS and requires all nodes to share a
common ROS master, which in a dynamic environment with multiple agents
quickly falls apart.

The rapyuta.io platform offers an elegant solution for multiple robot communication as a primary feature. In the rapyuta paradigm, the
component of each package is treated as an isolated ROS environment.
While declaring the package the user is only required to provide the
topics/services/actions required to be exposed by that particular
component. The platform is then responsible for connecting, managing
and securing the ROS environments together. We introduce a set of
new features aimed at making it a lot easier to use multiple robots.

#### ROS Environment Aliases
When deploying a component to a robot in a multi-robot scenario,
the platform expects the user to input a unique alias per component
(more on this in the next section).
This alias uniquely identifies the robot in an ensemble of connected
peers, i.e., components in the same package (each potentially deployed
in a physically different device/location) or dependent deployments.
The platform detects duplicates explicitly for the case of components
and deployment and its immediate parent. In the case of siblings
(two deployments depending on the same parent), the component with
a duplicate alias is considered a conflict and may enter an error
state. The user must be careful and ensure the uniqueness of identities
present in this case.

Each *components environment* offers a latched ROS topic
*/rapyuta_io_peers* of type *std_msgs/String*, which contains the
list of all connected peers in a comma-separated string, the first
entity is always the alias of the local bridge.

For example, **My_alias,peer_1,peer_2**

There may be more than one bridge locally depending on how you
deployed the packages and components so you may receive multiple
messages. In each case the first element is always the alias of the
bridge that published this message.

The end user can potentially use this information in their application
logic for multi-robot discovery.

#### Multi-Robot Communication Configuration
Imagine a game of robot soccer where players are robots, and their
head coach is a controller unit. The controller broadcasts the
message */move* to each player, while players broadcast their respective
pose and location through */odom*  for the controller to subscribe to it.
For instance, if the controller wants robot A to move in a specific direction,
it explicitly publishes */robotA/move*, and similarly publishes */robotB/move*
and */robotC/move* to robot B and robot C respectively. As more players are
added to the field, this approach gets complex and lacks the dynamic
binding between robot peers and the controller.

On the other hand, each robot peer (say A, B and C) explicitly
publishes */robotA/odom*, */robotB/odom* and */robotC/odom* messages for
the controller to subscribe. However, a complex launch file creates a
bottleneck in this case. Hence, the concept of targets and scopes are
introduced for supporting the discovery and addressing of multiple robots.

In the following sections, we discuss the possible communication
configurations that may be used to communicate in a multi-robot use case.
The presence of these options during package creation is used by the
platform to determine if it has to enforce alias constraints at
deployment time.

#### Scoped - Topics, Actions, Services
In this configuration, a user may declare a topic/service/action as
scoped by selecting the Scoped option. This indicates that when the
component is deployed the topic/service or action gets namespaced as
seen by the other robots by the alias of the deployed component.

For example, suppose robotA publishes */odom* topic in its local
ROS environment. While routing */odom* to either of the robot
peers (for instance a controller) the topic is prefixed with that
specific robot’s name, in this case */robotA/odom*.

![Scoped topic](/images/multi-robot-communication/scoped-topic.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

Mathematically, you can express ***scoped*** as:
A scoped topic is a mapping from a /topic to /robot-peer-name/topic.
{{% notice info %}}
**/odom -------> /robotP/odom**
{{% /notice %}}

![Scoped topic as shown](/images/multi-robot-communication/scoped-as-shown.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

{{% notice note %}}
If in the ROS Service logs you experience the error: ***incoming connection failed: unable to receive data from sender, check sender's logs for details***, please ignore it. The error message is generated by ROS internally as a side effect of the sniffing done by the cloud bridge so as to determine metadata related to ROSmsg type for the service. It has no other effects on your code and/or the code's functionality, and you can safely ignore it.

#### Targeted Topics
In the case of services and actions, where there is a clear semantic
of a provider and a caller, it is enough to apply a scope as each
agent that enters the system knows its own identity and provides
enough information to others to be able to reach it.

Topics do not innately have a sense of direction, thus scoping
alone does not suffice. We need a mechanism to address/targets
peers by their identities (aliases) dynamically.

For example, suppose robots in a particular scenario subscribe to the
topic */cmd_vel* to move about and a central controller needs to ask a
specific robot say robotA to move, then it needs to be able to target
only robotA and send messages to its */cmd_vel* subscription.

The controller in the above scenario publishes */robotA/cmd_vel* topic.
While routing */robotA/cmd_vel* the bridge strips the prefix ***robotA***
and publish the messages on the topic ***/cmd_vel*** in robotA’s local ros environment.

![Targeted topic](/images/multi-robot-communication/targeted-topic.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

Mathematically, you can express ***targeted*** as:
A targeted topic is a mapping from /robot-alias/topic to /topic.
{{% notice info %}}
**/robotP/cmd_vel -----------> /cmd_vel**
{{% /notice %}}

![Targeted topic as shown](/images/multi-robot-communication/target-as-shown.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

rapyuta.io  and the cloud bridge are responsible for maintaining
a list of agents,and ensuring that appropriate routing, subscriptions
and bridges are formed dynamically for each agent entering a
particular system.

#### Inbound Targeted Topics
This serves a purpose identical to the targeted topics albeit
in a dependant deployment scenario.

While creating the package, in the additional information
section, when one adds inbound ROS topics one can select the
***can be targeted*** . This metadata is used by the platform to
bridge communications and enforce alias constraints.
