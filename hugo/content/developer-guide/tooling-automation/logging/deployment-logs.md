rapyuta.io provides tabular searchable logs (*historical logs*) for components of a deployment both
in the cloud or on a device.

Additionally, for components deployed on the cloud, rapyuta.io offers a way
to stream (*live logs*) and follow stdout/stderr.

[Add a *ROS Publisher Exclusive* package](/getting-started/create-new-package)
that has a _Talker_ component with cloud runtime. It publishes the ROS topic _/telemetry_ with **Maximum** **QoS** as well as prints debug information to *stdout*. [Deploy the package](/getting-started/deploy-package) on the cloud by the name _ROS publisher exclusive deployment_

1. On the left navigation bar, click **DEPLOYMENTS**.
2. Select specific deployment whose logs you want to view or analyse. In this example, select _ROS publisher exclusive deployment_.
3. On the deployment's **DETAILS** tab, ensure the green progress bar is at **Succeeded** and **Status:Running** point.

## Stdout logs

To view or analyse the corresponding deployment logs, click **Historical Logs**.
![Deployment detials page](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/deployment-hist-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

A tabular listing of historical deployment logs is displayed, where each row consists of a log’s timestamp,
its component name and executable name, and its information or message.
![Historical logs table](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/tabular-hist-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

The table displays the most recent logs generated in the indicated time range. The widget fetches 500 log entries at a time. If the set of most recent logs contains more than 500 entries and you want to view logs not rendered in the first 500, use the **Load Previous Logs In Time Range** available at the top of the table. So, each time 500 new logs are fetched. You may use the time range selectors to narrow your search window.
![Load Remaining Logs In Time Range](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/load-remaining-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)
As you scroll to the bottom of the table and click **Load More Logs**, the table will append additional logs that are yielded after ***now***.
![Load Ahead Logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/load-ahead-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc) 

You can select a specific *component-executable* combination to view its corresponding logs.
You may also select multiple such combinations. If you select only a component’s name, you will
view all the logs generated by all of the executables of that component. If no component is selected,
you will view all the logs generated by all of the components that are deployed. For example,
the historical logs of only the **Talker** component are shown below.
![component-executable combination](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/cmpnt-exec-combo.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

You can choose to view logs from within a time range. However, ensure that the time slice is neither
in the past from the start time of a deployment nor in the future from now. You will be able to view
logs up to ***seven days*** in the past if a deployment has been running till now.

You can filter logs based on component name, executable name, timestamp or information using
[JavaScript regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).
The expression that you provide is wrapped in global modifier tags.
![JS Regex](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/JS-regex.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

Moreover, for advanced searching of logs, you will have to write a [lucene query](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html)
in the **Advanced Search** box.
![Advanced search](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/lucene-query.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

You may download historical logs of a deployment as a ***.log*** file by clicking the download button.
![Download logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/download-button.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

You may want to refresh the logs by clicking the refresh button.
![Refresh logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/refresh-button.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

Any errors or exceptions that occur while logs are being generated are redirected to ***stderr*** output window, but otherwise,
a valid logs output is displayed in ***stdout*** window.

## Indexed logs
To view the corresponding deployment logs in real time, click **Live Logs** tab. They are streamed in a terminal like window, and can be useful to view and debug your application in the cloud as it generates new logs. This is similar to the _"tail -f"_ functionality one is used to in a unix terminal console.

![Live Logs tab](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/realtime-logs/deployment-live-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

To search for a specific phrase in the continuous log stream, enter the phrase inside the **Search** box. If there is a match, all occurrences of matching patterns of the phrase are highlighted.

![Search live logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/realtime-logs/live-logs-search.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

You may view the logs in full screen mode by clicking on the **fullscreen** button that is located at the top left corner of the terminal-like window.

![View live logs in Full Screen](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/realtime-logs/live-logs-FS.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

On the other hand, the corresponding component-executable combination for which deployment logs are currently being streamed is displayed at the top right corner of the window.
