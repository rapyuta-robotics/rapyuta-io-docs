## Community Plan
rapyuta.io offers a community plan with a basic set of bundled complementary resource quotas that allow users to explore the platform for 3 months, no payments required. The community plan is recommended for academia, research, startups to help build a proof of concept of their application.

Additional [consumable units](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/#consumable-items) (upto the predefined limits for the plan) or optional resources such as persistent storage can be availed on a pay-as-you-go basis. This requires the user to add a valid [payment method](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/#credit-card-information) on the platform.

#### Expiry of cloud deployment resource quota
On __expiry of credits__ for cloud deployement hours the platform will __stop all running  cloud deployments__. All other functionality of the platform remains unaffected.

To continue using cloud deployments the user __must__ add a valid payment method by visiting the [Billing](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/) panel.

__Email Reminders:__ - a notification is sent  at **60%**, and another one at **90%**. A final email notification with a payment method is sent out when usage hits **100%**

Definition of cloud deployment is: any deployment with at least single cloud component

#### Expiry of trial period

On __end of the stipulated trial period__ the platform will __stop all running deployments__ and __delete all devices__ onboarded by the user. 
Since the deletion of resources is *__irreversible__*, the deployments and devices cannot be restored. Consequently, you will lose any information, like logs, associated with those resources.


To reactivate full functionality of the platform the user __must__ add a valid payment method by visiting the [Billing](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/) 


 __Email Reminders:__ - the first reminder to add a payment method is sent __7 days__ prior to the deadline, the next one __2 days__ prior to the deadline and the last one __3 hours__ before expiry.



## Professional Plan
The professional plan is recommended for small and medium businesses and startups in the pilot phase. This plan includes a larger quota of [consumable resources](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/#consumable-items), email support, basic SLA guarantees and access to premium consulting support from Rapyuta engineers that empower the user to build increasingly complex solutions.

Subscriptions to a professional plan require a user to add a valid [payment method](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/#credit-card-information). On subscribing to the plan, a fee is applied monthly and prorated for partial months.

## Enterprise Plan
The enterprise plan offers enterprise clients unfettered access to the platform, enterprise-grade 24x7 on-call support, SLAs and top of the line consulting expertise.
