## Community Plan
rapyuta.io offers a community plan with a basic set of bundled complementary resource quotas that allow users to explore the platform for 3 months, no payments required. The community plan is recommended for academia, research, startups to help build a proof of concept of their application.

Additional [consumable units](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/#consumable-items) (up to predefined limits for the plan) or optional resources such as persistent storage can be availed on a pay-as-you-go basis. This requires the user to add a valid [payment method](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/#credit-card-information) on the platform.

#### Automated Billing Notices
An email notification will be sent when the current usage percentage
(percentage of cloud deployment hours consumed) is at **60%**, and another one at **90%**. A final email notification with a payment method
is sent out at **100%** usage percentage at which point all of your cloud deployments will be **deleted**. As the trial period ends, the first reminder to add a payment method will be sent on the 7th day, and a second reminder will be sent on the 5th day. On the last day of the trial period, the account will be suspended and all of the resources with be deleted.

#### Automated termination of consumable resources on expiry of resource credits
Once the account is suspended, all deployments are stopped and deleted,
and all devices are removed from rapyuta.io completely. Since the
deletion of resources is *irreversible*, the deployments and devices cannot be restored. Consequently, you will lose any information, like logs, associated with those resources. You can re-activate your account by
adding credit card information on the
[Billing](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/) panel.

## Professional Plan
The professional plan is recommended for small and medium businesses and startups in the pilot phase. This plan includes a larger quota of [consumable resources](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/#consumable-items), email support, basic SLA guarantees and access to premium consulting support from Rapyuta engineers that empower the user to build increasingly complex solutions.

Subscriptions to a professional plan require a user to add a valid [payment method](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/#credit-card-information). On subscribing to the plan, a fee is applied monthly and prorated for partial months.

## Enterprise Plan
The enterprise plan offers enterprise clients unfettered access to the platform, enterprise-grade 24x7 on-call support, SLAs and top of the line consulting expertise.
