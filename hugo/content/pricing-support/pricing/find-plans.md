## Community Plan
The community plan is recommended for academia, research, startups with a proof of concept of their product. Subscribing to the community plan lets you try rapyuta.io platform for a trial period of 3 months for free.

A credit card is mandatory to purchase more add-ons,
volume and additional cloud deployment hours.

{{% notice info %}}
The trial period will end immediately on adding a credit card. Hence, it is advised to add a credit card on the last day of the trial period.

An email notification will be sent when the current usage percentage
(percentage of cloud deployment hours consumed) is at **60%**, and another one at **90%**. A final email notification is sent out at **100%** usage percentage at which point your account will be **suspended**.

Once the account is suspended, all deployments are stopped and deleted,
and all devices are removed from rapyuta.io completely. Since the
deletion of resources is *irreversible*, the deployments and devices cannot be restored. Consequently, you will lose any information, like logs, associated with those resources. You can re-activate your account by
adding credit card information on the
[Billing](/pricing-support/pricing/billing-usage/) panel.

## Professional Plan

The professional plan is advocated for small and medium businesses, and startups in the pilot phase. On subscribing to the plan, a subscription fee is applied monthly and prorated for partial months.
