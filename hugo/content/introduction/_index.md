## Welcome
Welcome to the rapyuta.io documentation, where you can find information
and guides to help you learn about rapyuta.io and start exploring its
features.

## What is rapyuta.io
rapyuta.io is a platform that enables robotics solution development by providing the necessary software infrastructure and facilitating the interaction between multiple stakeholders who contribute to the
solution development.

## In Detail
The software infrastructure can be seen as a collection of the
following four layers and the facilitation is enabled by hardware
and software catalogs.
