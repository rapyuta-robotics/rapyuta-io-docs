## October 14
Welcome to the October 14, 2020 release of the rapyuta.io platform. There
are significant updates in this release that we hope you will like.

#### Features
* **Docker Push/Pull Secret**

    The *rapyuta.io* platform allows you to push and save a docker image to a private registry and when you create a build by using a dockerfile and a private image is referenced, the platform uses a pull secret to fetch the image and create the build for you.
