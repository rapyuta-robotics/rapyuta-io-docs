## May 4

We have released a hotfix to address a vulnerability in SaltStack(which is internally used by rapyuta.io for managing devices.) 
As a security precaution, we have updated authentication keys for all the devices on-boarded to the platform, if you already have an existing device on rapyuta.io platform, please re-onboard the device to use it. 
To re-onboard your device, follow the below steps:     
1. Please select the device    
2. Click on Token button     
3. Copy the curl command    
4. Execute it on the physical device.     
We have preserved all the labels and metadata associated with a device.

Please reach out to us on support@rapyuta-robotics.com if you have any questions or concerns.
