## May 4

We have released an emergency hotfix to address a vulnerability in SaltStack(which is internally used by rapyuta.io for managing devices.) As a security precaution, we have updated authentication keys for all the devices on-boarded to the platform, if you already have an existing device on rapyuta.io platform, please re-onboard the device to use it. 

We will update with a postmortem soon.
