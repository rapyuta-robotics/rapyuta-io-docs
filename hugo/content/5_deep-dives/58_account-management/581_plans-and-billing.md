## Community Plan
rapyuta.io offers a community plan with a basic set of bundled complementary resource quotas that allow users to explore the platform for 3 months, no payments required. The community plan is recommended for academia, research, startups to help build a proof of concept of their application.

Additional [consumable units]({{< ref "/5_deep-dives/58_account-management/582_billing-usage.md">}}) (upto the predefined limits for the plan) or optional resources such as persistent storage can be availed on a pay-as-you-go basis. This requires the user to add a valid
[payment method](/5_deep-dives/58_account-management/understanding-usage/#payment-method) on the platform.

#### Expiry of Cloud Deployment Resource Quota
On the **expiry of credits** for cloud deployment hours in the Community Plan, the platform will **stop all running  cloud deployments**. All other functionality of the platform remains unaffected.

To continue using cloud deployments you **must** add a valid payment method on the **Billing** panel.

An email notification is sent when usage hits **60%**, and next at **90%**. A final email notification with a payment method is sent out at **100%**. 

{{% notice info %}}
Cloud deployment is any deployment with at least a single cloud component.

#### Trial Period Expiration
At the **end of the stipulated trial period** of the Community Plan, the platform will **stop all running deployments** and **delete all devices** on-boarded by the user.

Since the deletion of resources is ***irreversible***, the deployments and devices cannot be restored. Consequently, you will lose any information, like logs, associated with those resources.


To activate the full functionality of the platform again, you **must** add a valid payment method on the **Billing**.

The first reminder to add a payment method is sent ***7 days*** prior to the expiration date, the second one ***2 days*** prior to the expiration date, the third one ***1 day*** prior to the expiration date and the final one ***3 hours*** before expiry.

## Professional Plan
The professional plan is recommended for small and medium businesses and startups in the pilot phase. This plan includes a larger quota of [consumable resources]({{< ref "/5_deep-dives/58_account-management/582_billing-usage.md">}}), email support, basic SLA guarantees and access to premium consulting support from Rapyuta engineers that empower the user to build increasingly complex solutions.

Subscription to the professional plan require users to add a valid **payment method**. On subscribing to the plan, a fee is applied monthly and prorated for partial months.
