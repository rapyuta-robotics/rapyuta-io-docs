###  Does platform support ROS2?

As of now the rapyuta.io platform doesn't support ROS2. 

### How can I remove a deployment?

Click the **Deployment** page, select the deployment that you want to remove and click **De-provision**. After you de-provision a deployment, the deployment is removed from the rapyuta.io platform. Note that after you de-provision a deployment, you'll loose all the data of the deployment.
