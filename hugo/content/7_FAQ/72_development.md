#### Q. How can I remove a deployment?
>{{%expand "Answer"%}}
  Click the **Deployment** page, select the deployment that you want to remove and click **De-provision**. After you de-provision a deployment, the deployment is removed from the rapyuta.io platform. Note that after you de-provision a deployment, you'll loose all the data of the deployment.
