Logging Introduction

Logs are verbose text messages and are used for debugging and monitoring.
Logs are generated when rapyuta.io builds the source code of a git repository,
by a device and during the life cycle of deployment.

rapyuta.io collects and indexes log data. There are three types of logs produced:

1. [Build Logs](../build-logs)
2. [Deployment Logs](../deployment-logs)
3. [Device Logs](../device-logs)

All types of logs are only available for seven days, after which they are
automatically destroyed.
