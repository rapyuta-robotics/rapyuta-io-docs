[Add a _ROS Publisher Exclusive_ package](/getting-started/create-new-package)
that has a _Talker_ component with cloud runtime. It publishes *\telemetry*
ROS topic with **High** **QoS**. [Deploy the package](/getting-started/deploy-package)
on the cloud by the name _ROS publisher exclusive deployment_

1. On the left navigation bar, click **DEPLOYMENTS**.
2. Select specific deployment whose logs you want to view or analyse. In this
   example, _ROS publisher exclusive deployment_ is selected.
3. On the deployment's **DETAILS** tab, ensure the green progress bar is at
   **Succeeded** and **Status:Running** point.

## Historical logs

To view or analyse the corresponding deployment logs, click **Historical Logs**.

A tabular listing of buffered deployment logs, where each row consists of a log’s timestamp,
its component name and executable name, and its information or message. There are up to 500
log entries fetched at a time. To view the next 500 entries, you will have to scroll down to
the end of the table until you see a **Load More** button. If log entries have not been exhausted,
additional entries are displayed on clicking **Load More**. Otherwise, the error message
**Unable to fetch logs** is shown.

You can select a specific *component-executable* combination to view its corresponding logs.
You may also select multiple such combinations. If you select only a component’s name, you will
view all the logs generated by all of the executables of that component. If no component is selected,
you will view all the logs generated by all of the components that are deployed. For example,
the buffered logs of only the **Talker** component are shown below.

You can choose to view logs from within a time range. However, ensure that the time slice is neither
in the past from the start time of a deployment nor in the future from now. You will be able to view
logs up to seven days in the past if a deployment has been running till now.
![Time Interval](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/time-range.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

You can filter logs based on component name, executable name, timestamp or information via
[JavaScript regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).
The expression that you provide is preffixed with **/** and suffixed with **/g** tags.
Moreover, for advanced searching of logs, you will have to write a [lucene query](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html)
in the advanced search box.

You may download the historical logs of a deployment in ***.log*** file by clicking the download button.

You may want to refresh the logs by clicking the refresh button.
