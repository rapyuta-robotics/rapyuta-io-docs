Logs of a deployment are available as *historical logs* and are streamed continuously (*live logs*) in real time.

[Add a *ROS Publisher Exclusive* package](/getting-started/create-new-package)
that has a _Talker_ component with cloud runtime. It publishes the ROS topic 
_\telemetry_ with **Maximum** **QoS** as well as prints debug information to *stdout*. [Deploy the package](/getting-started/deploy-package)
on the cloud by the name _ROS publisher exclusive deployment_

1. On the left navigation bar, click **DEPLOYMENTS**.
2. Select specific deployment whose logs you want to view or analyse. In this
   example, _ROS publisher exclusive deployment_ is selected.
3. On the deployment's **DETAILS** tab, ensure the green progress bar is at
   **Succeeded** and **Status:Running** point.

## Historical logs

To view or analyse the corresponding deployment logs, click **Historical Logs**.

A tabular listing of historical deployment logs, where each row consists of a log’s timestamp,
its component name and executable name, and its information or message is displayed.
![Historical logs table](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/tabular-hist-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

There are up to 500 log entries fetched at a time. To view the next 500 entries, you will have to scroll down to the end of the table until you see a **Load Ahead Logs** button. If log entries have not been exhausted,
additional entries are displayed on clicking **Load Ahead Logs**.

To view the previous 500 log entries, you will have to
scroll up to the top of the table until you see a
**Load Remaining Logs In Time Range** button, and click
it.

You can select a specific *component-executable* combination to view its corresponding logs.
You may also select multiple such combinations. If you select only a component’s name, you will
view all the logs generated by all of the executables of that component. If no component is selected,
you will view all the logs generated by all of the components that are deployed. For example,
the buffered logs of only the **Talker** component are shown below.

You can choose to view logs from within a time range. However, ensure that the time slice is neither
in the past from the start time of a deployment nor in the future from now. You will be able to view
logs up to ***seven days*** in the past if a deployment has been running till now.

You can filter logs based on component name, executable name, timestamp or information using
[JavaScript regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).
The expression that you provide is preffixed with **/** and suffixed with **/g** tags.

Moreover, for advanced searching of logs, you will have to write a [lucene query](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html)
in the **Advanced Search** box.

You may download historical logs of a deployment as a ***.log*** file by clicking the download button.
![Download logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/download-button.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

You may want to refresh the logs by clicking the refresh button.

2. Select specific deployment whose logs you want to view or analyse. In this example, _ROS publisher exclusive deployment_ is selected.
3. On the deployment's **DETAILS** tab, ensure the green progress bar is at **Succeeded** and **Status:Running** point.

## Streaming logs
To view the corresponding deployment logs in real time, click **Live Logs** tab. They are streamed continuously in a terminal-like window, while you analyse the logs.

![Live Logs tab](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/realtime-logs/deployment-live-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

To search for a specific phrase in the continuous log stream, enter the phrase inside the **Search** box. If there is a match, all occurrences of matching patterns of the phrase are highlighted.

![Search live logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/realtime-logs/live-logs-search.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

You may view the logs in full screen mode by clicking on the **fullscreen** button that is located at the top left corner of the terminal-like window.

![View live logs in Full Screen](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/realtime-logs/live-logs-FS.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

On the other hand, the corresponding component-executable combination for which deployment logs are currently being streamed is displayed at the top right corner of the window.
