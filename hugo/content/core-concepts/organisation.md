An organization is an enterprise customer or a small business team or
an individual developer like you who is interested and willing to use
rapyuta.io for building efficient robotics applications.

Every organization has an _admin_, that is, the very first user that registers and
signs into rapyuta.io. Since the _admin_ is the first person to sign into
rapyuta.io, they must provide details of their organization such as
its name, official website, location etc. rapyuta.io grants the admin the
highest privilege than any user can have. For example, the _admin_ can invite users
to explore rapyuta.io, remove certain users from rapyuta.io, can view and access
the billing panel.

The organization panel displays information relevant to an organization and a
list of *Activated* users.
