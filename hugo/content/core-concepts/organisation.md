A _partner organisation_ receives an email with links to [rapyuta.io console](https://closed-beta.rapyuta.io)
and this documentation. Once an organisation exhausts its maximum count,
no additional users can access rapyuta.io console.

If you are the very first user from your organisation to access rapyuta.io
console, you will have to fill in the details of your organisation. For example,
you should provide your organisationâ€™s name, its official website url and
location on the organisation details page.

rapyuta.io allows an organisation to create a finite number of resources
(devices, packages, deployments, builds etc.) to your organisation. Each resource
that you utilise counts on your organisation regardless how the resources are
used.
