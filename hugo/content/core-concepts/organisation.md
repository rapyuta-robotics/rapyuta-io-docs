An organization is an enterprise customer like you who is interested and
willing to use rapyuta.io for building efficient robotics applications.

An _admin_ - the first user who registers and signs into rapyuta.io - is
assigned to an organization. Since the _admin_ is also the very first user who
signs into rapyuta.io, they must provide details about the organization such as
its name, official website and location. They have higher privileges than
other users in the same organization. For example, the _admin_ can invite users
(belonging to the same organization) to explore rapyuta.io, remove certain users
from using rapyuta.io. They alone can access the **BILLING** panel.

The **ORGANIZATION** panel contains information about an organization along with a
list of **Invited** and **Activated** users. Your billing account is tied to your
organization.
