A _partner organisation_ receives an email with links to [rapyuta.io console](https://closed-beta.rapyuta.io),
this documentation and an unique _invite code_. You (a user of rapyuta.io console from
a partner organisation) must use this _invite code_ to register and access the
console. When you log into the console for the first time, you must provide
the _invite code_ just once. There is a limit on the number of users who use
the invite code to access the console for the first time. Once an
organisation exhausts its maximum count, no additional users can access
rapyuta.io console.

If you are the very first user from your organisation to access rapyuta.io
console, you will have to fill in the details of your organisation. For example,
you should provide your organisationâ€™s name, its official website url and
location on the organisation details page.

rapyuta.io allows an organisation to create a finite number of resources
(devices, packages, deployments, builds etc.) to your organisation. Each resource
that you utilise counts on your organisation regardless how the resources are
used -  as a user or a group. You can create [groups of users](../resource-user-group)
for sharing resources. But, the users in a group must belong to the same organisation.

An _invite code_ has a maximum count. Once a _partner organisation_ exhausts its
maximum count, no more users can access rapyuta.io console.
