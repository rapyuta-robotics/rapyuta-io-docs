An organization is an enterprise customer or a small business team or
an individual developer like you who signs up for rapyuta.io and subscribes
to its tools and services for building efficient robotics applications.

Each organization has an _admin_, that is, the very first user that registers and
signs into rapyuta.io. The *admin* is responsible for on-boarding the organization
onto rapyuta.io and providing necessary details (e.g. organization name, website)
to complete the registration process. rapyuta.io grants highest privilege to the
admin than any user can have, and is responsible for managing users (invite/remove)
and billing.

The organization panel displays information relevant to an organization and a
list of *Activated* users.
