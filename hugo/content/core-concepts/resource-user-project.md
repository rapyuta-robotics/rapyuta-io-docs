## Resources
A resource is an entity that rapyuta.io provides to its users for building robotics applications, for example:

* A device that is already on-boarded on to the platform
* A package that is added to the platform
* A deployment that is run either on a device or in the cloud
* A package build
* A secret

## Users
A user represents the end user of rapyuta.io with a unique email address and sign in credentials. They can manage resources such as devices, deployments, secrets, packages and builds.

A user can be either in **Invited** state or in **Activated** state. They may be an *admin* and are responsible for managing the [organization](/core-concepts/organisation/).

## Projects
A project is an entity that enables users to logically isolate and organize resources within an organization.

Each rapyuta.io project has:

* a project name
* a project ID
* the projectâ€™s creator name
* the creation timestamp

Each project name and project ID is unique.

You may create multiple projects and use them to organize rapyuta.io resources.

The project's creator must [add users from the organization to the project](/getting-started/add-user-to-project) in order for them to collaborate.
