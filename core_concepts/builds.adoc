= Builds

An application build converts your source code into runnable rapyuta.io package artifacts. Build recipes are used to tell the build engine
how to build your source code. Builds are automatically triggered once you specify a build recipe and a source repository during package creation.

== Build recipes
A build recipe contains instructions to build applications of a particular type. For example catkin-based ROS applications, Django applications with
NGINX web server, etc. They can be used by developers to standarize the build process for applications across a team.
Build recipes allow the platform to provide tailored build environments for an application type. For example, they can make choices on build tools,
security policies, logging and monitoring tools, etc.
	
An application build is specified during package creation as shown in the example below:
