= Builds

An application build converts your source code or docker images into runnable rapyuta.io package artifacts. An
application build is specified during package creation as shown in the example below:

image::executables.png["Specifying a new executable from a git repository."]

[NOTE]
rapyuta.io currently only supports docker images for components for *Cloud* runtime. You can submit any x86_64 docker
images during the package creation by referring to the images's registry address.

= Secrets
A secret is an object which consists of sensitive data such as a password, SSH private key, SSL certificate needed by
rapyuta.io to access and build/use private resources like git repositories or docker images. Placing this data in a
Secret object enables better control over its usage, and reduces any potential risk of exposure. rapyuta.io enables you
to manage this data from the *Secrets* tab in the console UI.

[TIP]
A Secret provides a layer of abstraction between the container and a set of credentials.

You can create these secrets from Secrets tab in the console UI.

== Secret Types

rapyuta.io provides two secret types:

* *Docker Pull Secret*
* *Source Secret*

== Docker Pull Secret

When the user wants to use a docker image from his private docker registry to create a package, access to the registry
is required by rapyuta.io. Docker secrets are used to provide rapyuta.io with access to private docker registries. You
can create these secrets by following the instructions given in the next section.

[[core_concepts-builds-docker_secret_type]]
There are two types of Docker Pull Secrets:

* *Docker Hub*: If the docker registry is link:https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub]
* *Private Registry*: For any other private docker registry

==== Step-by-Step Instructions

To use docker images from a private docker registry in rapyuta.io *Packages*, the user only has to create a
*Docker pull secret* for the docker registry. After creating the *Docker pull secret*, the user can use any docker
image in the registry for *Package* creation. rapyuta.io will use the information from the Docker pull secret to pull
and use these docker images.

The steps given below will help you add a Docker Pull Secret:

1. Login to link:http://console.rapyuta.io[console.rapyuta.io]
2. Click *Secrets* from the left navigation panel in the console UI
3. Click *ADD NEW SECRET*
+
On clicking *ADD NEW SECRET*, you will be taken to a modal window where you can create new secret as shown in the image
below:
+
image::secret_types.png["Selecting Docker pull secret",650]
+
On selecting Docker Pull Secret, you will be taken to a modal window where you can create a new secret as shown in
the image below:
+
image::create_docker_secret.png["Creating Docker pull secret",650]
4. Fill in the form with the particulars of the docker registry and click *Submit*. In the case of a private registry,
click the checkbox for link:#core_concepts-builds-docker_secret_type[Private registry]. In this case, you also have to
fill in the registry url in the *Registry Url* part of the form. The other fields are described below:
+
* Username: This is your user ID for Docker Hub or the private registry
* Password: This is your password for the docker registry
* Email: This is the email address used for the docker registry

== Source Secret
When using source code from a private git repository to create a package, access to the registry is required by
rapyuta.io. Source secrets are used to provide rapyuta.io with access to private git repositories or git repositories
with self-signed or untrusted SSL certificates.

There are two types of Source Secret, namely:

* *Basic Authentication*: For access with user's username and password or git access token
* *SSH Authentication*: For access with a private SSH key for the repository

==== Step-by-Step Instructions
To use the source code from a private git repository in rapyuta.io *Packages*, the user only has to create a
*Source secret* for the git repository. After creating the *Source secret*, the user can use the source code from the
matching git repository for *Package* creation. rapyuta.io will use the information from the Source secret to pull
and build the source code into runnable artifacts.

The steps given below will help you add a Source Secret:

1. Login to link:http://console.rapyuta.io[console.rapyuta.io]
2. Click *Secrets* from the left navigation panel in the console UI
3. Click *ADD NEW SECRET*
+
On clicking ADD NEW SECRET, you will be taken to a modal window where you can create new secret as shown in the image
below:
+
image::secret_types.png["Creating Source secret"]
4. Select *Source Secret*
5.  Fill in the secret creation form. The description of the fields is given below:
+
*For Basic Authentication secrets:*
+
image::source_secrets_basic.png["Specifying a new source secret with basic authentication.",650]

* Name: User provided name for the source secret
* Authentication Type: The link:#core_concepts-builds-source_secret[type] of source secret
* *Password* or *Token*:
The user can choose between providing access via either username and password or a git access token
+
--
For *Password*, the following fields are required:

- Username: The git username
- Password: The password of the user for the repository

For *Token*, the following field is required:

- Token: The git access token for the repository
--

* Source URL pattern: The regular expression that represents the URLs of git repositories that the user wants to provide
access to. Read link:#core_concepts-builds-source_uri[Source URLs].
* Use CA certificate: If your Git server uses a self-signed or untrusted certificate, you can use this option. Password
or token fields are optional, if ca.crt is given.

+
--
*For SSH Authentication:*

image::source_secrets_ssh.png["Specifying a new source secret with SSH key authentication.",650]

* Name: User provided name for the source secret
* Authentication Type: The link:#core_concepts-builds-source_secret[type] of source secret
* SSH key: The private SSH key. Follow these tutorials to add SSH keys for your
https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/[GitHub] or
https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html[Bitbucket] repository.
* Source URL pattern: The regular expression that represents the URLs of git repositories that the user wants to provide
access to. Read link:#core_concepts-builds-source_uri[Source URLs].
* Use CA certificate: If your Git server uses a self-signed or untrusted certificate, you can use this option. Password
or token fields are optional, if ca.crt is given.

== Additional Concepts

[[core_concepts-builds-source_uri]]

* *Source URL patterns*

You can specify your Git server url patterns using _Source URL patterns_ field.
Build engine will match the Git source given in the Package definition to these
source URLs and will then use the containing source secret to build the package.

image::source_secrets_uri_patterns.png["URL patterns for source secrets",650]

A URL pattern must consist of:

* a valid scheme (*://, git://, http://, https:// or ssh://).

* a host (* or a valid hostname or IP address optionally preceded by *.).

* a path (/* or / followed by any characters optionally including * characters).

In all of the above, a * character is interpreted as a wildcard.

URL patterns only match Git source URLs which are conformant to RFC3986. For
example, https://github.com/rapyuta/sample.git. They do not match the
alternate SSH style that Git also uses. For example,
git@github.com:rapyuta/sample.git. It is also not valid to include a
username/password component in a URL pattern.


If multiple secrets match the Git source of a particular Package, Build Engine will
select the secret with the longest match. This allows for basic overriding. For
example, secret with source URL https://\*.rapyuta-robotics.com/* will match with any SCM
server in the domain rapyuta-robotics.com accessed over HTTPS but secret with source URL
https://ioconsole.rapyuta-robotics.com/* will override configurations for ioconsole.rapyuta-robotics.com
