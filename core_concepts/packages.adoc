== Terminology

=== Executables
An Executable refers to a runnable element. This runnable element can be:

* Name: A name is an identifier for your executable.

* A Docker image: The docker registry endpoint is accepted as an executable. Rapyuta.io pulls this image from the docker
registry when a link:../core_concepts/deployments.html[deployment] is triggered.

* A Git repository: A git repository is accepted as an executable. Rapyuta.io builds this code to generate the docker
executable. Refer to link:../core_concepts/builds.html[builds] for more information (the platform builds this into a
runnable docker image). The command specified with this repository is run with the generated docker image.

* A command: A simple shell command is accepted as an executable. If a git or docker reference is provided, this shell command overrides
the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cmd-default-command-or-options[CMD] of the docker image while we
 don't allow the overriding of link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#entrypoint-default-command-to-execute-at-runtime[entry-point].
 *Otherwise, if no git or docker reference is provided, just the command can form an executable. In this case, the
 executable can only run on a device environment (not the cloud).* Rapyuta.io assumes that all dependencies required
 to run this command are already present in the device runtime where the command is expected to run.

[TIP]
If the 'Run command from bash shell' box is checked, the specified command is executed with an invocation of the shell using `/bin/bash -c`.
Make sure bash binary is present in the docker image.

=== Components
A component is a set of link:#executables[executables] that need to be deployed in unison on the desired target
link:#required-runtime[runtime] This means that these executables can share a specified file system ensuring data
locality, and can communicate via IPC. Also, any executable listening on a port can be accessed by its sibling
executables via `localhost`.

[TIP]
Create your own packages following link:../getting_started/creating_new_package.html[these instructions].

== Packages
A Package is the smallest unit of deployment in rapyuta.io. A package is a composition of components that can be
deployed on devices, cloud or both. A package needs to be added to the
link:service_catalog.html#design-patterns-with-rapyuta-io[service catalog] before it can be deployed. Packages support
multiple configurations by using link:#plans[plans]. *A package must hold at least one plan.*

=== Plans
Plans allow the author of a package to offer different plans with different components and different configuration.
When deploying a package, the user deploying the package chooses a plan for the package she wants to deploy.


For instance, the author of a ROS talker-listener package can offer two plans, one with a ROSBridge and one without,
the user of the package can choose one of these plans at the time of deployment.

[TIP]
As a guideline, applications that are very similar but differ in either configuration or might have/lack an
extra component should be described as different plans within a package rather than describing them in different
packages.

=== Exposing Network Endpoints from a component
link:#core_concepts-packages-component[Components] can expose network endpoints. The configuration of these endpoints
(exposed port, the protocol to be used, etc.) can be specified during the creation of the package. The supported protocols
are Secure TCP(TLS/SNI), HTTP/Websocket, and HTTPS/Websocket-Secure.


During deployment, rapyuta.io creates an accessible public network endpoint for each exposed network endpoint automatically.
The actual link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name[FQDN] of this endpoint can be observed from
the deployment page of the console UI.

[NOTE]
The Secure TCP(TLS/SNI) endpoint uses link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[SNI] headers for routing the
request to the desired backend.

=== Required Runtime
The required runtime allows the author of the package to restrict the runtime of a component to either device or the
cloud. This allows the author to restrict components designed to run on a device from being deployed on the cloud and
vice versa. The required runtime is optional and can be left empty in the cases where its possible for the component to
run on either the device or the cloud.

=== Configuration Parameters
The configuration needed for running a link:#core_concepts-packages-component[component] can be specified during
package creation in the "Configuration Parameters" section of the component in the package creation form. The author
needs to specify the needed Configuration Parameters as string keys, also adding defaults values for these keys. The
final values of these parameters are specified while deploying the package. These values override the defaults
specified during package creation.

The Configuration Parameters are injected into the runtime of the component as environment variables. The name of the
environment variable will be the string key specified during package creation and the value of this environment
variable will be the value specified during deployment or the default specified during package creation(if no value was
specified during deployment). The executables can now consume these through standard environment lookup techniques (eg
in python one could use `os.environ`)

=== Exposed Parameters
Exposed Parameters are link:#configuration-parameters[configuration parameters] that the package wants to expose to any
other package that intends to use the current package as a dependency. This information is used for
link:service_catalog.html#package-inheritance[package inheritance].

=== ROS Configuration
In ROS applications, each component can share a list of ROS topics, services, and actions with other components. The
executables can subscribe to any topic or call services or actions that are exposed by other components
(see the link:../overview/application_architecture.html[application architecture]). This configuration should be
specified during the creation of the package.

[NOTE]
The author does not have to include the ROS master as an executable of a component if it is meant to run on the
cloud. The platform manages running ROS master for the author on the cloud. Starting the ROS master on the devices
whenever necessary needs to done by the author, by including it as an executable.

Since this communication can happen over WAN
(via the link:../core_concepts/network_layout_communication.html#core_concepts-network-cloud_bridge[cloud bridge]),
the author can tune the level of reliability for the transport layer. The `QoS` (quality of service) attribute of
the package reflects this function. For example, `max` QoS for a topic indicates that all messages published to a topic
are guaranteed to reach the subscribers of the topic. The offered QoS values are `max`, `hi`, `med`, `low`.

.*Why not just use “max” QoS for all topics?*
[IMPORTANT]
QoS is proportional to the latency of the message: the average latency of `max` QoS topics is higher than of `med`
topics.

=== Inbound ROS Interfaces
When creating a package, the "Inbound ROS Interfaces" indicate

* The ROS topics that the current package allows to be published on by any deployment(of an other package) that intends
to use the current package as a dependency
* The ROS services, actions that the current package can call of any deployment(of an other package) that intends
to use the current package as a dependency


Please refer to the design patterns section on the
link:service_catalog.html#dependant-deployments[service catalog] for more details on composition using packages.

== Dependencies and Composition
rapyuta.io allows for a number of design patterns that help you compose an application using a combination of one or
more packages. Please refer to the design patterns section of the
link:service_catalog.html#design-patterns-with-rapyuta-io[service catalog] docs for an overview.
