= Service catalog

The service catalog is a curated collection of public and private packages. It can be used to accelerate development by focusing on modularity and
reusability of packages. 

If a user creates a package in a group, all members of this group have access to this package. If he/she were to create a package outside the scope
of any group, only he/she would have access to this package.

== Third Party services
rapyuta.io provides some commonly used packages that any user can use to accelerate their application development.
