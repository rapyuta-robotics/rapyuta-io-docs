= Build Recipes

Build recipes provide a simple and straightforward "`source to Docker image`" capability for your applications. Build recipes encapsulate the build process and setup of platform-supported logging, monitoring and security stack for a particular language runtime
 or framework. 

The advantages of using build recipes include the following: 

. *Patchability* - Build recipes allow the platform to provide seamless security and performance updates for your language runtime or framework as the output image can be easily patched by updating the base image. 
. *Ecosystem* - Build recipes encourage a shared ecosystem where you can leverage best practices for your applications.


== Build Recipe Detection

The platform performs a deep search on your application repository to determine language runtime and framework and tries to find a matching build recipe. The smart detection can be overridden with user provided build recipes.
