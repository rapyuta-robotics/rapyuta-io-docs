== Overview
The Device Manager provides the control-plane and a minimal data-plane
communication between the device and the platform.
This is single point of contact for all device related functions.

== Architecture

== Communication
Device Manager Service uses a server-agent communication model. The server
 component is called the *Device Manager*, and the agent is called the
  *Device Manager Client* (or *DM Client*).

==== NAT Traversal

Works behind firewalls, NAT network as the connections are initiated by the
 DM Client to the Device Manager Service. You do not need to open any incoming
  ports on your firewall.

==== Communication Channels
DM communicates with registered devices using a publish-subscribe pattern.

There are two communication channels:

*Control Channel*: This is used to send all the control commands from DM
Service to DM client and receive event messages from DM Client through
 a persistent connection.

*Metric Channel*: DM Client connects to this channel as required to send the
 collected metric data to DM Service.

== Remote Execution
Device Manager provides you with the remote execution system which means accessing your device
- locally which is present at some remote location connected over WAN.
You can open an interactive shell to the device through the web browser
(link:../../developer_guide/device_management/webssh.html[WebSSH]) or send
commands to be individual commands to be executed on the device(sync/async).

Commands can be run on the device independent of the device location and
firewall status.

== Remote Monitoring
Remote Monitoring helps you to get better visibility into your devices wherever
 they happen to be located. DM service enables you to collect and visualize real
  time metrics such as cpu usage, memory usage, battery level from the device.

Custom metrics can also be exported and visualized from the device through ROS topics.

link:../../developer_guide/device_management/device_metric_collection.html[User Dashboards documentation].

== Application Deployment
You can remotely deploy custom user applications on the device and manage
 it's lifecycle.
You can start, stop, get status, logs of the running application.

The supported application runtime are docker and generic linux. The docker
runtime allows for application provisioning on a live device.

==== Application Runtime

===== Docker

The runtime allows for live provisioning of the application on devices.

===== Generic Linux

Allows you to launch, maintain and watch status of any linux application.
 Doesn't support live provisioning.


== Dynamic Device Selection

Device selection allows you to deploy applications to devices based on various
properties. It includes dynamic properties like metrics
(battery capacity, wind speed, location, etc) and static properties like
 labels are also supported.

This can be defined in the link:packages.html[_Package Manifest_] at the time
 of application deployment.


== Security

The architecture of Device Manager service includes security aspects to assure
 that all the data (both control and telemetry) are encrypted when exchanged
  between components.

==== End to End Encryption
After a device is successfully registered with DM, all further communication
 between DM and
 DM Client is encrypted using public key cryptography.

==== Identity validation
All devices are registered to DM with unique credentials that can only be visible to you.
 These credentials are used to identify devices across communication channels.
