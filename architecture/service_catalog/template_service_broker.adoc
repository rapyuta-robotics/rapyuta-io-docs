[NOTE]
====
Enabling the template service broker is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not
supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be
functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for
production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features,
enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the
development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

To opt-in during installation, see

the Template Service Broker].

The _template service broker_ (TSB) gives the service catalog visibility into
the xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#using-the-instantapp-templates[default Instant App and Quickstart templates] that have shipped with {product-title}
since its initial release. The TSB can also make available as a service anything
for which an {product-title}
xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template] has been
written, whether provided by Red Hat, a cluster administrator or user, or a
third party vendor.

By default, the TSB shows the objects that are globally available from the
*openshift* project. It can also be configured to watch any other project that a
cluster administrator chooses.
