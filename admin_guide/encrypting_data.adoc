[[encrypting-data-overview]]
== Overview

This topic shows how to enable and configure encryption of secret data at datastore layer. While
examples use the `secrets` resource, any resource can be encrypted, such as *configmaps*.

[[encrypting-data-configuration]]
== Configuration and Determining Whether Encryption Is Already Enabled

In order to activate experimental support for data encryption, an argument
*--experimental-encryption-provider-config* should be passed to the Kubernetes API server:

.Excerpt of *_master-config.yaml_*

[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    experimental-encryption-provider-config:
    - /path/to/encryption-config.yaml
----

For more information about *_master-config.yaml_* and its format, see
xref:install_config/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[Master Configuration
Files] topic.

<1> Each `resources` array item is a separate config and contains a complete configuration.
<2> The `resources.resources` field is an array of Kubernetes resource names (*resource* or
*resource.group*) that should be encrypted.
<3> The `providers` array is an ordered xref:encrypting-data-providers[list of
the possible encryption providers]. Only one provider type may be specified per entry (*identity* or
*aescbc* may be provided, but not both in the same item).
<4> The first provider in the list is used to encrypt resources going into storage.
<5> Arbitrary name of the secret.
<6> Base64 encoded random key. Different providers have different key lengths. See instructions
below xref:encrypting-data-process[how to generate key].
====

When reading resources from storage each provider that matches the stored data attempts to decrypt
the data in order. If no provider can read the stored data due to a mismatch in format or secret
key, an error is returned which prevents clients from accessing that resource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If any resource is not readable via the encryption config (because keys were changed),
the only recourse is to delete that key from the underlying etcd directly. Calls attempting to
read that resource will fail until it is deleted or a valid decryption key is provided.
====

[[encrypting-data-providers]]
=== Available Providers

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,3"]
|===
| Name | Encryption | Strength | Speed | Key Length | Other Considerations

| *identity*
| None
| N/A
| N/A
| N/A
| Resources written as-is without encryption. When set as the first provider, the resource will be
decrypted as new values are written.

| *aescbc*
| AES-CBC with PKCS#7 padding
| Strongest
| Fast
| 32-byte
| The recommended choice for encryption but may be slightly slower than *secretbox*.

| *secretbox*
| XSalsa20 and Poly1305
| Strong
| Faster
| 32-byte
| A newer standard and may not be considered acceptable in environments that require high levels of
review.

| *aesgcm*
| AES-GCM with a random initialization vector (IV)
| Must be rotated every 200k writes
| Fastest
| 16, 24, or 32-byte
| *Is not recommended* for use except when an automated key rotation scheme is implemented.

|===

Each provider supports multiple keys. The keys are tried in order for decryption, and if the
provider is the first provider, the first key is used for encryption.

[NOTE]
====
Kubernetes has no proper nonce generator and uses a random IV as nonce for AES-GCM. Since AES-GCM
requires a proper nonce to be secure, AES-GCM is not recommended. The 200k write limit just limits
the possibility of a fatal nonce misuse to a reasonable low margin.

[[encrypting-data-process]]
== Encrypting Data

Create a new encryption config file

[source,yaml]
----
kind: EncryptionConfig
apiVersion: v1
resources:
  - resources:
    - secrets
    providers:
    - aescbc:
        keys:
        - name: key1
          secret: <BASE 64 ENCODED SECRET>
    - identity: {}
----

To create a new secret perform the following steps:

. Generate a 32 byte random key and base64 encode it. For example, on Linux and
macOS the following command can be used:
+
----
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The encryption key must be generated with an appropriate cryptographically secure random number
generator like *_/dev/urandom_*. For example, `math/random` from Golang or `random.random()` from
Python are not suitable.
====

. Place that value in the *secret* field

. Restart API server

[IMPORTANT]
====
The encryption provider config file contains keys that can decrypt content in etcd, so you must
properly restrict permissions on masters so only the user who runs the master API server can read it.
====


[[encrypting-data-verification]]
== Verifying that Data is Encrypted

Data is encrypted when written to etcd. After restarting the API server any newly created or
updated secrets should be encrypted when stored. To check, you can use the `etcdctl` command line
program to retrieve the contents of your secret.

. Create a new secret called `secret1` in the `default` namespace:
+
----
oc create secret generic secret1 -n default --from-literal=mykey=mydata
----

. Using the `etcdctl` commandline, read that secret out of etcd:
+
----
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get /kubernetes.io/secrets/default/secret1 -w fields [...] | grep Value
----
+
where *[...]* must be the additional arguments for connecting to the etcd server.
+
The final command may look like this:
+
----
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get /kubernetes.io/secrets/default/secret1 -w fields \
--cacert=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/ca.crt \
--key=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/master.etcd-client.key \
--cert=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/master.etcd-client.crt \
--endpoints 'https://127.0.0.1:4001' | grep Value
----

. Verify that the output of the command above is prefixed with *k8s:enc:aescbc:v1:* which
indicates the *aescbc* provider has encrypted the resulting data.

. Verify the secret is correctly decrypted when retrieved via the API:
+
----
oc get secret secret1 -n default -o yaml | grep mykey
----
+
should match *mykey: bXlkYXRh*

[[encrypting-data-migration]]
== Ensure All Secrets are Encrypted

Since secrets are encrypted on write, performing an update on a secret will encrypt that content.

----
oc adm migrate storage --include=secrets --confirm
----

The command above reads all secrets and then updates them to apply server side encryption.
If an error occurs due to a conflicting write, retry the command.
For larger clusters, you may wish to subdivide the secrets by namespace or script an update.


[[encrypting-data-rotation]]
== Rotating a Decryption Key

Changing the secret without incurring downtime requires a multi step operation, especially in
the presence of a highly available deployment where multiple API servers are running.

. Generate a new key and add it as the second key entry for the current provider on all servers

. Restart all master processes to ensure each server can decrypt using the new key

. Make the new key the first entry in the *keys* array so that it is used for encryption in the
config

. Restart all master processes to ensure each server now encrypts using the new key

. Run `oc adm migrate storage --include=secrets --confirm` to encrypt all existing secrets with the
new key

. Remove the old decryption key from the config after you back up etcd with the new key in use and
update all secrets

With a single API server step 2 may be skipped


[[encrypting-data-decryption]]
== Decrypting Data

To disable encryption at datastore layer place the *identity* provider as the first entry in the config:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: EncryptionConfig
apiVersion: v1
resources:
  - resources:
    - secrets
    providers:
    - identity: {}
    - aescbc:
        keys:
        - name: key1
          secret: <BASE 64 ENCODED SECRET>
----

and restart all master processes. Then run the command `oc adm migrate storage --include=secrets --confirm`
to force all secrets to be decrypted.
