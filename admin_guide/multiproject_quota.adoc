== Overview

A multi-project quota, defined by a `*ClusterResourceQuota*` object, allows
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#admin-guide-quota[quotas] to be shared across
multiple projects. Resources used in each selected project will be aggregated
and that aggregate will be used to limit resources across all the selected
projects.

[[multi-project-quotas-selecting-projects]]
== Selecting Projects

Projects can be selected based on either annotation selection, label selection, or both.
For example:

====
----
$ oc create clusterquota for-user \
     --project-annotation-selector openshift.io/requester=<user-name> \
     --hard pods=10 \
     --hard secrets=20
----
====

creates:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ClusterResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: for-user
spec:
  quota: <1>
    hard:
      pods: "10"
      secrets: "20"
  selector:
    annotations: <2>
      openshift.io/requester: <user-name>
    labels: null <3>
status:
  namespaces: <4>
  - namespace: ns-one
    status:
      hard:
        pods: "10"
        secrets: "20"
      used:
        pods: "1"
        secrets: "9"
  total: <5>
    hard:
      pods: "10"
      secrets: "20"
    used:
      pods: "1"
      secrets: "9"
----
<1> The `*ResourceQuotaSpec*` object that will be enforced over the selected projects.
<2> A simple key/value selector for annotations.
<3> A label selector that can be used to select projects.
<4> A per-namespace map that describes current quota usage in each selected project.
<5> The aggregate usage across all selected projects.
====

This multi-project quota document controls all projects requested by
*<user-name>* using the default project request endpoint. You are limited to 10
pods and 20 secrets.


[[multi-project-quotas-viewing-applicable-clusterresourcequotas]]
== Viewing Applicable `*ClusterResourceQuotas*`

A project administrator is not allowed to create or modify the multi-project
quota that limits his or her project, but the administrator is allowed to view the
multi-project quota documents that are applied to his or her project. The
project administrator can do this via the `*AppliedClusterResourceQuota*`
resource.

----
$ oc describe AppliedClusterResourceQuota
----

produces:

====
----
Name:   for-user
Namespace:  <none>
Created:  19 hours ago
Labels:   <none>
Annotations:  <none>
Label Selector: <null>
AnnotationSelector: map[openshift.io/requester:<user-name>]
Resource  Used  Hard
--------  ----  ----
pods    1 10
secrets   9 20

[[multi-project-quotas-selection-granularity]]
== Selection Granularity

Due to the locking consideration when claiming quota allocations, the number of
active projects selected by a multi-project quota is an important consideration.
Selecting more than 100 projects under a single multi-project quota may have
detrimental effects on API server responsiveness in those projects.
