= Application architecture

A rapyuta.io link:../core_concepts/packages.html#core_concepts-packages-component[component] is either a generic component or a ROS component.

The platform provides ways to expose TCP and HTTP endpoints when deployed on the cloud. Both ROS and generic components can leverage these types of endpoints.

== Architecture of a ROS component
For a ROS component, the platform launches a ROS master and a 
link:../core_concepts/network_layout_communication.html#core_concepts-network-cloud_bridge[cloud bridge]. Each cloud bridge exposes a user-specified
set of ROS topics, services, and actions for the component and receives similarly exposed ROS topics, services, and actions from other components.

[NOTE]
You do not have to explicitly run the cloud bridge or ROS master while deploying the application. Their lifecycle is managed by the platform.
