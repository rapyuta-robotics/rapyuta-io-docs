== Overview
The Device Manager provides the control-plane and a minimal data-plane communication between the device and the platform.
This is the single point of contact for all device-related functions.

== Architecture

== Communication
The Device Manager Service uses a server-agent communication model. 
The server-side component is called the *Device Manager*, and the agent is called the *Device Manager Client* (or *DM Client*).

==== NAT Traversal

Works behind firewalls, NAT network as the connections are initiated by the DM Client to the Device Manager Service. 
You do not need to open any incoming ports on your firewall.

==== Communication Channels
DM communicates with registered devices using a publish-subscribe pattern.

There are two communication channels:

*Control Channel*: This is used to send all the control commands from DM
Service to DM client and receive event messages from DM Client through
 a persistent connection.

*Metric Channel*: DM Client connects to this channel as required to send the
 collected metric data to DM Service.

== Remote Execution
Device Manager provides you with the remote execution system, which means that you can
access your device even if it is present at some remote location connected over WAN.
You can open an interactive shell to the device through the web browser
(link:../../developer_guide/device_management/webssh.html[WebSSH]) or send individual
shell commands to be executed on the device(sync/async).

== Remote Monitoring
Remote Monitoring helps you to get better visibility into your devices wherever they happen to be located. 
DM service enables you to collect and visualize real-time metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, battery level from the device.

Custom metrics published by ROS topics can also be exported and visualized.

link:../../developer_guide/device_management/device_metric_collection.html[User Dashboards documentation].

== Application Deployment
You can remotely deploy your software applications on the device and manage its lifecycle.
You can start, stop, get status and logs of the running applications.

The supported application runtimes are *Docker* and *Generic Linux*. The docker
runtime allows for application provisioning on an online device.

==== Application Runtime

===== Docker

This runtime allows for live provisioning (docker pull) of the application on devices.

===== Generic Linux

Allows you to launch, manage and watch the status of any Linux application. It doesnâ€™t support live provisioning
but expects the device owner to provision the application on the device.



== Dynamic Device Selection

Device selection allows you to deploy packages on devices based on various
properties. It includes dynamic properties like metrics
(battery capacity, wind speed, location, etc) and static properties like device labels.

This can be defined at the time of application deployment.


== Security

The architecture of Device Manager includes security aspects to assure
 that all the data (both control and telemetry) are encrypted when exchanged
  between components.

==== End to End Encryption
After a device is successfully registered with DM, all further communication
 between DM and
 DM Client is encrypted using public key cryptography.

==== Identity validation
All devices are registered to DM with unique credentials that can only be visible to you.
 These credentials are used to identify devices across communication channels.
