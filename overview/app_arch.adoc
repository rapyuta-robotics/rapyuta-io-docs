= Architecture of a rapyuta.io application

=== Package
A Package is a composition of software *_Components_* that can be deployed on devices, cloud or both. A *_Package_* needs to added to the *_Service Catalog_* before it can be deployed. A *_Package_*â€™s lifecycle can be managed through the platform.

=== Executable
An Executable refers to a runnable element of a *_Component_*. This runnable element can be

* A docker image
* A Git repository and command to run (The platform builds this into a runnable artifact)

=== Component
A *_Component_* is a list of *_Executables_* that need to be deployed in unison. A *_Component_* can also refer to an existing *_Package_* from the *_Service Catalog_*.

=== Architecture
rapyuta.io provides a unified *ROS* environment across multiple devices and the cloud. Each rapyuta.io *_Component_* exposes a set of ROS topics, services and actions to the application and receives similarly exposed ROS topics, services and actions from other *_Components_*. 

This is attained by the *_Cloud Bridge_*, which is rapyuta.io agent that runs with the *_Executables_* of each Component. You can choose the ROS topics, services and actions that are exposed when creating a *_Package_*. 

[NOTE]
====
You do not have to explicitly run the *_Cloud Bridge_* while deploying a *_Package_*. Its lifecycle is managed by the platform.
