== Updating and Upgrading the Operating System

Updating or upgrading your operating system (OS), by either changing OS versions
or updating the system software, can impact the {product-title} software running
on those machines. In particular, these updates can affect the `iptables` rules
or `ovs` flows that {product-title} requires to operate.

Use the following to safely upgrade the OS on a host:

. Ensure the host is unschedulable, meaning that no new pods will be placed onto the host:
+
----
$ oadm manage-node <node_name> --schedulable=false
----

. Migrate the pods from the host:
+
----
$ oadm drain <node_name> --force --delete-local-data --ignore-daemonsets
----

. Update or upgrade the host packages, and reboot the host. A reboot ensures
that the host is running the newest versions, and means that the `docker` and
{product-title} processes have been restarted, which will force them to check
that all of the rules in other services are correct.
+
However, instead of rebooting a node host, you can restart the services that are
affected, or preserve the `iptables` state. Both processes are described in the
xref:../../admin_guide/iptables.adoc#admin-guide-iptables[{product-title}
IPtables] topic. The `ovs` flow rules do not need to be saved, but restarting
the {product-title} node software will fix the flow rules.

. Configure the host to be schedulable again:
+
----
$ oadm manage-node <node_name> --schedulable=true
----
